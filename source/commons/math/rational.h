/**	Declaration of type rational, implementing a number of the kind r/s, where r and s are #t_atom_long integers.
	A rational is said to be standard as long as s != 0.

	A few conventions are needed to operate with rationals:
	If the rational is negative, the element having the minus sign has to be the numerator (r)
	If the rational is positive, both r and s have to have the plus sign
	If the rational is null, numerator has to be 1 (so no 0/4, 0/5, 0/32 fractions should be considered)
	If the (nonstandard) rational is of the kind 0/n (n>0) then it has to be reduced to 1/0 
	If the (nonstandard) rational is of the kind 0/n (n<0) then it has to be reduced to -1/0 
	It is a good rule to keep every #t_rational reduced in lowest terms, by using the function rat_reduce()
 
	Notice that the only nonstandard rationals allowed with these conventions are 1/0, -1/0 and 0/0.
 
	You don't have to follow explicitely all these conventions when operating with rationals, as long
	as you use them with the API functions. For instance, performing a rat_rat_sum() always assures that
	the result will fulfill all these conventions.
 
	To create a rational, you should use the genrat() or the long2rat() functions.

					The standard behaviour is to keep 0 <= r < 1, so that i = floor(q).
					Within this convention, we're sure that if we can represent, say, 7 + r, we can surely represent,
					say, 12932045 + r also. In general, if you can represent i + r, you can of course represent i' + r
