Version 3.11.4	2011-12-19  Axel Roebel

	* sdif/SdifFGet.c:
	Gracefully handle NVT tables that do not include a trailing \000
	as for examples the once written with the writesdif function in the old
	matlab sdif toolbox. Obligation to have a trailing 0 in the 1NVT
	matrix is not required in the SDIF specs and therefore the
	present change seems appropriate.
	* CMakeLists.txt, configure.in, include/sdif.h.in:
	Fixed a number of issues with the conditional include of stdint.h and sys/types.h in instaled include file
	sdif.h.
	Correctly use the types provided by these include files for definition of sdif types.
	* sdif/SdifFile.c: Fixed ftruncate implementation on windows.
	* CMakeLists.txt: Fixed source location for installation of sdif.h;
	* CMakeLists.txt, configure.in, include/sdif.h:
	fixed use of stdint.h to be persistent in sdif.h even after
	installation.
	Added a complete configuration search to determine
	SdiffPosT type such that it becomes a 64bit type.
	* CMakeLists.txt, README, configure.in, include/sdif.h, sdif/SdifErrMess.c, sdif/SdifFile.c:
	Fixed large file support to properly work on linux as well.
	* include/sdif.h, sdif/SdifErrMess.c, sdif/SdifFile.c:
	Fixed Sdif[fF]GetPos and Sdif[fF]SetPos to correctly support large files (>2GB).

Version 3.11.3   2011-04-06 Diemo Schwarz (unreleased)

	* SdifQuery reallocates SdifQueryTree dynamically 
	  (now even ircamdescriptor output files can be queried)

Version 3.11.2   2009-08-10  Diemo Schwarz

	* fix matrix selection for SdifQuery: In SdifReadFile
          function, check if matrix header is selected before calling
          matrix callback.
	* reimplemented querysdif using SdifQuery for consistency
	  added flags to switch header, nvt, and type def printing
	* in sdiftotext, accept in/outfile without -i/-o also

Version 3.11.1   2009-01-07  Diemo Schwarz

	* Further Improvements of the public API for scripting
	  languages binding to libSDIF:
          - access functions for integration in script languages for
	    all fields of: name-value table list, name-value table,
	    name-value entry
	  - iterator to iterate over all entries in hash table
	* examples/list-nvt.c: nvt listing example

Version 3.11.0   2009-01-05  Diemo Schwarz

	* Improvements of the public API for scripting languages binding 
	  to libSDIF:
	  - added SdifHashTableGetNbData
	  - added access methods to struct elements of type definitions.
	* examples/list-types.c: simple example showing
          SdifTestFrameType and direct access to struct elements
	* tools/querysdif.c: support for frames that do not contain any matrix
	* macosxbuild/SDIF.xcodeproj: builds Mac UB framework, include
          current updated SDIF.xcodeproj, generated sdif_version.h for
          mac building out of the box

Version 3.10.8   2008-05-22  Axel Roebel

	* added SDIF_API to SdifFCleanCurrSignature.

Version 3.10.7  2008-04-07  Axel Roebel

        * add support for gcc visibility (cmake configuration only)

        * use stdint.h to determine integer types if this file is available

Version 3.10.6  2006-12-11  Axel Roebel

        * added support for cmake project configuration system

Version 3.10.5	2005-05-05  Diemo Schwarz, Niels Bogaards

	* doc/standard/sdif-standard.html updated
 	* querysdif: exit on invalid sdif header, added brief output option
	* sdifextract: added data only output option
	* lots of small fixes, 64-bit compilation

Version 3.10.0	2005-05-23  Diemo Schwarz, Axel Roebel

	* Unified error handling code	
	* Sdiffread*/Sdiffwrite* functions with SdifFileT instead of FILE *
	  -> eof error reporting makes more sense
	* SdifFScanNameValueLCurrNVT reimplemented for ascii only

Version 3.9.3	2005-05-13  Diemo Schwarz

	* SdifReadSimple: robustness to corrupt sdif files (\n -> \r\n)

Version 3.9.2	2005-04-07  Diemo Schwarz, Niels Bogaards

	* sdifextract: added time ouput format to extract only the
          times of selected frames
	* redundant header files and functions removed

Version 3.9.1	2004-10-07  Axel Roebel

	* Fixed SdifFGetOneNameValue to properly read NVTs from text files.
	* Fixed SdifStringToNV to only convrt \t and \n.

Version 3.9.0	2004-09-09  Diemo Schwarz

	* SdifFReadMatrixData: read and store a whole matrix's data as
	  one block, accessed with the functions SdifFCurrMatrixData,
	  SdifFCurrMatrixDataPointer, with automatic reallocation.
	* SdifReadSimple: simple callback-based reading of an entire SDIF file.
	* SdifListConcat function
	* SdifIsAReservedChar return value changed to boolean flag, clearer
	* SdifSelectAppendList function

	* optimisations give overall run time improvement of 40% on read/write

Version 3.8.2	2004-05-03  Axel Roebel and Diemo Schwarz

	* reading from pipes possible

Version 3.8.1	2004-02-10  Axel Roebel
