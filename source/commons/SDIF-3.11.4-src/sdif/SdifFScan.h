 * $Log: SdifFScan.h,v $
 * Revision 3.5  2003/08/06 15:11:45  schwarz
 * Finally removed obsolete functions (like SdifSkip...).
 *
 * Revision 3.4  2001/05/02 09:34:42  tisseran
 * Change License from GNU Public License to GNU Lesser Public License.
 *
 * Revision 3.3  2000/11/21 14:51:49  schwarz
 * - sdif.h is now included by all sdif/Sdif*.c files.
 * - Removed all public typedefs, enums, structs, and defines from the
 *   individual sdif/Sdif*.h files, because they were duplicated in sdif.h.
 * - Todo: Do the same for the function prototypes, decide which types and
 *   prototypes really need to be exported.
 * - Removed SdifFileStruct.h.
 * - Preliminary new version of SdiffGetPos, SdiffSetPos.  They used the
 *   type fpos_t, which is no longer a long on RedHat 7 Linux.
 *
 * Revision 3.2  2000/10/27 20:03:30  roebel
 * autoconf merged back to main trunk
 *
 * Revision 3.1.2.2  2000/08/21  21:35:11  tisseran
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 3.1.2.1  2000/08/21  14:04:13  tisseran
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 3.1  1999/03/14  10:56:46  virolle
 * SdifStdErr add
 *
 * Revision 2.3  1999/01/23  15:55:45  virolle
 * add querysdif.dsp, delete '\r' chars from previous commit
 *
 * Revision 2.2  1999/01/23  13:57:29  virolle
 * General Lists, and special chunk preparation to become frames
 *
 * Revision 2.1  1998/12/21  18:27:12  schwarz
 * Inserted copyright message.
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1998/11/29  11:41:36  virolle
 * - New management of interpretation errors.
 * - Alignement of frames with CNMAT (execpt specials Chunk 1NVT, 1TYP, 1IDS).
 * _ Sdif Header File has a Sdif format version.
 * - Matrices order in frames is not important now. (only one occurence of
 *   a Matrix Type in a Frame Type declaration )
 * - Hard coded predefined types more dynamic management.
 * - Standart streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) set as binary for Windows32 to
 *   have exactly the same result on each plateforme.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1998/11/10  15:31:43  schwarz
 * Removed all 'extern' keywords for prototypes, since this is redundant
 * (function prototypes are automatically linked extern), and it
 * prohibits cocoon from generating an entry in the HTML documentation
 * for this function.
