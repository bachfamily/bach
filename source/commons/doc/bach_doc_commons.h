#define BACH_DOC_PAINTJIT
    // The <m>paintjit</m> message, followed by the name of a jitter matrix,
    // mirrors the canvas of the object onto the jitter matrix.
    // The matrix should have either 1 or 4 planes, and should have at least 2 dimensions.
    // The first two dimensions are used; the matrix is automatically resized to the needed dimensions.
    // Retina resolution is not supported (retina objects are mirrored in standard resolution).
	
#define BACH_DOC_REGULARITYBOXES
	//	Regularity boxes are a concept that helps bach.quantize quantizing properly by preserving untouched important beat positions. 
	//  Indeed, bach.quantize's algorithm is a box-based algorithm: bach.quantize first cuts a measure into different boxes (for instance having widths of 1/4 each, but the default boxes depend
	//  on the time signature in general), and then performs the quantization in each box. This allows things falling almost exactly on box boundaries to be kept exactly on the box boundaries,
	//  so that they may not float due to quantization errors. You can assign custom boxes by explicitely saying which boxes you want. 
	//  You have to give a llll for each voice (in our case, just one), containing for each measure: either a rational number, which represents the 
	//  width of each box (e.g. <b>1/8</b>] and which will be repeated; or a list, containing explicitely the box width for each box, e.g. <b>[1/4 3/4]</b>.
	//  This has to be done for each voice, so that for instance a list like <b>[1/8 2/4] [] [[1/4 3/4] 1/8]</b> sets to 1/8 the boxes for firt measure of first voice, 
	//  to 2/4 the boxes for second measure of first voice (and all the possibly following ones); leaves by default the boxes of second voice; sets explicitely to <b>[1/4 3/4]</b> the boxes for
	//  the first measure of the third voice and then to 1/8 for all the following ones.
	//  <br /> <br />
	
#define BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_MODULO
	// 	In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
	//	points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_PC_AND_PCSET
	//  A pitch-class set is a plain collection of pitch-classes. A pitch class is nothing but the representative of a set of pitches.
	//  Traditionally, it corresponds to the concept of "note", once we abstract it from its octave. 
	//  For instance, the semitonal framework (when the modulo is 12), all the C belong to the same pitch-class
	//  which will be named 0 = {..., C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, ...}. The pitch-class 1 will be the one containing all C#'s (or Db's); pitch-class
	//  2 will contain all D's, and so on. One will use to name pitch class numbers from 0 to the modulo - 1: indeed, with modulo = 12, pitch-class 12 will coincide
	//  with pitch-class 0 (it'll be the C one octave higher). One can thus think at pitch-classes as equally spaced points on a clock, and transposing
	//  means rotating them on the clock. A pitch class set is thus represented just by a plain list of pitch classes, such <b>0 4 7</b>, representing the
	//  C major chord. Notice that this coincides with any other representation such as <b>12 4 19</b> or <b>0 -8 -5</b>, but the canonical form, where numbers
	//  are from 0 to the modulo-1 is always preferred. Also for pitch-class sets the order of elements is immaterial, and thus
	//  <b>0 4 7</b> or <b>4 0 7</b> or <b>7 4 0</b> will all represent the same set.
	//  On the other hand a pitch-class (as an abstract concept) can be used to represent things other than pitches, 
	//  as for instance temporal position in a rhythmic pattern (loop) having a certain number (the modulo) of equally spaced elements.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_GROUPS
	// 	In Set Theory, two pitch-class sets are often considered to be "the same" when they are linked by the action of some simple transformation.
	//  For instance, the sets <b>0 1 4</b> and <b>2 3 6</b> are linked by a transposition of 2 (corresponding, on the clock diagram, to a rotation of 2 steps).
	//	Such "simple transformations" usually form a group. One thus usually needs to choose a group to determine a framework; this group will entail
	//  the concept of "copy" of a pitch-class set: which is any other pitch-class set obtained by the action of a transformation of the group.
	//	For instance, if our group is the group of transposition, <b>2 3 6</b> is a copy of <b>0 1 4</b>, and viceversa. <br />
	//  The most common groups of such form in increasing nesting are: <br />
	//	- the group of transposition: formed by all the transposition by a certain amount, and there are only 12 transposition if our modulo is 12, or
	//  in general n transposition if our modulo is n (the mathemathicians would say that such group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_n).
	//	For instance, a C major chord is the same as a D major chord, with respect to this group, but it is NOT the same as a C minor chord. <br />
	//	- the group of transposition and inversions: formed by all the transposition of the previous group, plus all the combination of such transposition with
	//  inversions, i.e. reflection with respect to any axis on the clock diagram. If our modulo is n, this group has 2n elements (the mathemathicians 
	//	would say that such group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_n).
	//  For instance, a C major chord is the same as a D major chord, with respect to this group, and also the same as a C minor chord. <br />
	//	- the affine group of transposition, inversions, and multiplications: this group (here things get a little bit more complicated...) is formed
	//	by all the elements of the previous group plus we add the transformation multiplying each pitch class by a certain number k (prime with the modulo).
	//  Classical multiplications, with modulo = 12, are M_5 (multiplication by 5) and M_7 (multiplication by 7).
	//  For instance, our <b>0 4 7</b> C major chord is the same as <b>0 8 11</b>, since 5 * (0 4 7) = (0 20 35) = (0 8 11). <br />
	//  Up to the group of transposition and inversion, the interval vector of a pitch-class set is preserved. The affine group does not preserve the interval vector.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_PRIMEFORMORDERINGCRITERION
	//	The prime form is always defined to be the "smallest" copy of a given set. This definition depends on the ordering one chooses.
	//  Two ordering are supported by bach: <br />
	//  <m>Lexicographic</m>: the prime form is the "smallest" copy of the set lexicographically (numbers are compared left to right).
	//	For instance <b>0 1 5 11</b> is preferred to <b>0 6 7 8</b>. <br />
	//  <m>CompactnessÂ First</m>: the lexicographic clause is secondary: primarily the prime form is chosen among the "most compact" prime forms,
	//  For instance <b>0 6 7 8</b> is preferred to its transposed <b>0 1 5 11</b>, although it is not preferred to its other transposed <b>0 1 2 6</b>.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_MATRIXCALCULUS_MATRIX
	// 	In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
	//  For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
	//  i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same 
	//  as the number of rows.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_TONEDIVISION
	// 	In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,
	//  by representing the number of steps in which each tone is divided.
	//  For the standard semitonal representation (where just sharps and flats suffice), one can stick with 
	//  <m>tonedivision</m> being 2, meaning: the tone is divided into two semitones.
	//  By increasing this value, the microtonal grid gets more dense: for instance, 4 is the quartertonal grid
	//  (where each tone is divided in 4 quartertones); 8 is the eight-tonal grid, and so on.
	//  <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_ACCIDENTALSPREFERENCES
	// 	Sets how non-natural notes should be represented: <br />
	//  - Auto: let bach choose a default representation. <br /> 
	//  - Sharps: always choose sharp accidentals (more precisely, in general: always 
	//  choose a representation such that the displayed diatonic pitch is below the actual note). <br /> 
	//  - Flats: always choose flat accidentals (more precisely, in general: always 
	//  choose a representation such that the displayed diatonic pitch is above the actual note). <br /> 
	//  - Custom: use a custom enharmonic table, defined via the <m>enharmonictable</m> attribute.
	//  <br /> <br />		
	
#define BACH_DOC_ACCIDENTALSGRAPHIC
	// 	Sets the way of displaying accidentals: <br />
	//  - None: no accidental is displayed. <br />
	//  - Classical: accidentals are displayed with the classical symbols (sharps, flats...). 
	//  This option is only available if <m>tonedivision</m> is 2, 4 or 8. <br />
	//  - Fraction: accidentals are displayed as fractions of tone (e.g. "-1/4" for quartertone flat or "+1/2" for
	//  an ordinary sharp). <br />
	//  - Unreduced Fraction: as the previous one, but fractions are never reduced. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is
	//  48 one would have "+2/8" and not "+1/4". Denominator of each fraction is the <m>tonedivision</m>
	//  (thus a tonedivision 2 has denominators 2, as expected for standard sharps and flats). <br />
	//  - Cents: accidentals are displayed as cents differences with respect to the diatonic note. 
	//  Remark that, unless <m>tonedivision</m> is 100, the displayed cents difference will not in general correspond to the 
	//  real cents difference: the first one will be indeed a cents difference snapped to the chosen microtonal grid.
	//  For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 8, a note having midicents 6027 will be displayed as a middle C with a "+25cents" accidental.
	//  <br /> <br />		

#define BACH_DOC_ENHARMONICTABLE
	//  An enharmonic table is a string of elements defining the accidentals to be used for each step of the chromatic scale.
	//  A symbol for each voice (containing such string of characters) is expected. If less symbols than the number of voices
	//  are defined, the last one is padded.
	//  The number of elements in the string depends on the <m>tonedivision</m>; more precisely it is the <m>tonedivision</m> multiplied by 6. 
	//  Standard case is <m>tonedivision</m> = 2, and thus the full 12 steps must be defined.
	//  Elements are sequencies of characters associated to accidentals.
	//  For instance "bb" is associated to a double flat, while "#+" is associated to a three quarter tones sharp.
	//  Such elements are to be separated by white spaces. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 12, a string like
	//  <b>enharmonictable "n # n b n n b n b n b x"</b> says that the C must be represented as natural, the note above will
	//  be a C# (and not a Db), the one above a D natural, the one above a Eb (and not a D#), and so on. Last note says that
	//  the B will actually be a Ax (A double diesis). <br />
	//  @copy BACH_DOC_ACCIDENTALS_ASCII_CONVENTION
	//  <br /> <br />		

#define BACH_DOC_NOTENAMESSTYLE
	// 	In the bach environment you can choose to represent note names in two different ways: either with the latin
	//	symbols (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) or with the anglo-saxon letters (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). 
	//  <br /> <br />	
		
#define BACH_DOC_MIDDLECOCTAVE
	// 	The octave number corresponding to the octave where the middle C is. It is usually either 4 or 3, depending
	//  on the musical culture. By default, in bach, this is 4, i.e. C4 is the middle C. 
	//  <br /> <br />	
	
#define BACH_DOC_ACCIDENTALS_ASCII_CONVENTION
	// 	In the bach environment, accidentals can be written or output as ascii using the following symbols: <br />
	//  # for stanard 1/2 tone sharp <br />
	//  b for stanard 1/2 tone flat <br />
	//  x for stanard tone sharp <br />
	//  bb for stanard tone flat <br />
	//	+ for 1/4 tone sharp; <br />
	//	d or - for 1/4 tone flat; <br />
	//	#+ for 3/4 tone sharp; <br />
	//	db for 3/4 tone flat; <br />
	//	^ for 1/8 tone up; <br />
	//	v for 1/8 tone down. <br />
	//	Of course, these symbols can be combined, like in #+^ or dv.
	//	The 1/8 symbols are used also for smaller intervals (at output time).
	//  <br /> <br />	
	
#define BACH_DOC_EMBED
	// 	Toggles the ability to save the content with the patch when this latter is saved. 
	//  The default behaviour is 1 (save the data with the patch).
	//  <br /> <br />	

#define BACH_DOC_MARKERROLES
	// 	In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
	//  time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers 
	//	also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo. 
	//  When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter, 
	//  and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
	//	Roles can be: <br />
	//  <m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
	//  For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
	//  <m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
	//  value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
	//  that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
	//  <m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
	//  For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
	//  <m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
	//  For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
    //  <m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
    //  For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
	//	All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
	//  entire bach.roll.
	//  <br /> <br />	

#define BACH_DOC_LAMBDA
	//  A certain number of bach objects are equipped with "lambda" inlets and outlets. These inlets and outlets - 
	//  always the rightmost ones - serve the purpose of letting you define a function the object will base its behavior upon.
	//  Such function is indeed a patching loop: parameters are taken from the lambda outlet(s), processed, and the "result" is
	//  plugged in the lambda inlet(s). The type of function, and the corresponding expected result, depend on the object behavior;
	//  for instance, cycles modifying elements will expect as "result" the modified element; cycles testing for custom equalities will
	//  expect a 0/1 answer (0 meaning: not equal; 1 meaning: equal), as well as cycles testing custom inequalities and sorting (1 meaning: the two 
	//  elements are in the correct order; 0 meaning: the order is wrong). Refer to each specific object to know more about it.
	//  With many objects, it is not mandatory to provide an evaluation cycle: if you don't, a default function will be used. <br />

	//  Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
	//  timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
	//  - <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice. 
	//  For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
	//  - <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
	//  but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
	//  For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
	//  - <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number, 
	//  in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
	//  For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
	//  important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures. 
	//  <br />
	//  A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
	//  point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1. 
	//  Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end 
	//  of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
    //  <br />
    //  If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
    //  For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
    //  <b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

	//  The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding 
	//  values is the following one: <br />
	//  - <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
	//  vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline, 
	//  so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
	//  instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
	//  - <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure 
	//  spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values 
	//  greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the 
	//  width factor is changed. <br />
	//  - <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
	//  can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
	//  't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
    //  'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
	//  - <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will 
	//  not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
	//  show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically 
	//  assigned measure number (default). <br />
	//  - <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers. 
	//  Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise. 
	//  Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure. 
	//  If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
	//  <b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
	//  This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>. 
	//  Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
	//  As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
	//  compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

	//  "filelist", "llll", "spat", "togglematrix", "intmatrix", "floatmatrix", "filter, "dynfilter", "color", "3dfunction",
    // "articulations", "notehead, "dynamics", "none".  <br />
    //  -Â <b>access</b>: sets the slot accessibility, and expects a symbol. Default is "readandwrite" (slot is readable and writable);
    // you can also use "readonly" (slot is only readable, not writable via interface), or "none" (slot window can't even be opened, slot
    // content cannot be accessed).<br />
    //  - <b>temporalmode</b>: sets whether the slot contains temporal information, and if so in which form.
    //  It expects one of the following symbols: "none" (the information is not temporal), "relative" (the information is temporal, and the X value
    //  of each slot item is a relative position inside the note duration, usually between 0 and 1), "milliseconds" (the information is temporal, and the X
    //  value of each slot item is defined as a position milliseconds with respect to the note onset). <br />
    //  - <b>extend</b>: toggles the ability for temporal slots to extend their content beyond the end of each corresponding note (might be also useful,
    //  in combination with the "milliseconds" temporalmode, in order to define continuous parameters, independently from a note duration). <br />
	//  â <b>range</b>: followed by two numbers, sets the minimum and maximum values the slot range (vertical axis for function and 3dfunction slots, or number

	//  â <b>height</b>: a value determining the height of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). You can also put "auto" 
	//  if you want to leave an automatically calculated height (default). <br />

	//  upon Shift+Ctrl+Alt+mousedrag (mac). <br />
	//  â <b>domain</b>: followed by two numbers, for function and 3dfunction slots, replaces the standard 0 to 1 domain with any input domain (input numbers 
	//  are minimum and maximum). <br />
	//  â <b>domainslope</b>: a slope (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially rescale the domain display. <br />
	//  â <b>default</b>: a numeric value (for numeric slots) determining the slot default value. <br />
	//  â <b>representation</b>: it could expect one of the following things. 1: Symbols defining units of measurement (e.g. "Hz", "ms"...), for numeric 
	//  slots one symbol is expected, for function slots if one symbol is given, it is applied to the Y axis, if two symbols are given they are 
	//  applied to the X and Y axis, for 3dfunction slots up to three symbols can be given, the third one referring to the Z axis, use <b>nil</b> or
	//  <b>[]</b> to skip assignment for an axis. For filter and dynfilter slots, you can assign "Hz" or "cents" as unit of measurement
	//  and it will be used to display the cutoff frequency accordingly. 2: An enumeration list (only for int 
	//  and intlist slots), mapping each integer to an element of this enumeration list (e.g. in an int slot from 1 to 3, a 
	//  slot_representation "(one two three)" will display "one" at the place of 1, "two" at the place of 2, "three" at the place of 3). 
	//  These symbols will never be output upon dump or play, they will be just displayed. 3: 
	//  For matrix-typed slots, it can be either a llll containing the number of rows and columns, such as (3 4), or a llll containing 
	//   the names of the rows and columns, such as ((or fee foo) (col1 col2 col3)). To give units to different axes, just list them, such as: Hz dB.
	//  â <b>zrange</b>: as "range", but for the Z spatial dimension (used by the 3dfunction slot: the Z dimension is the one "coming out" from the screen). <br />
	//  â <b>zslope</b>: as "slope", but for the Z spatial dimention (used by the 3dfunction slot). <br />
	//  â <b>singleslotfortiednotes</b>: (for bach.score only) tells whether tied sequences of notes have just one slot, the one corresponding 
	//  to the first note of the sequence. <br />
    //  â <b>copywhensplit</b>: tells whether this slot should be copied when a note is split into a sequence of multiple notes (e.g. via quantization). <br />
    //  -Â <b>follownotehead</b>: forces to automatically modify the value of the slot depending on the notehead trimming (useful if the slot
    //   value is something associated to the notehead, such as the starting point for reading a sample).<br />
	//  <br />
	//  You are not obliged to input all the fields: you can give as input only the required fields.
	//  Also at output, only the needed fields are given (e.g. the "zrange" is only output for 3dfunction slots, and so on).
	//  Setting an individual field for a given will not change any other field, unless the type is changed, in which case
	//  a conversion on all the slots is performed (if possible, i.e. if slots are compatible) otherwise the slot data of the given slot is lost.

	//  - <b>background</b>: this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to be constantly painted in the background or 0 otherwise. 
	//  This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>bgslots</m> attribute. <br />
	//  - <b>popup</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to show up in the note+popup+menu, or to 0 otherwise. 
	//  This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>popupmenuslots</m> attribute. <br />
	//  - <b>rightclick</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one wants that the right click (or two-fingers tap) on a note head directly 
	//  pops up the slot window of the current slot, or to 0 otherwise.
	//  This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>rightclickslot</m> attribute. <br />
	//  - <b>linkto</b> (except bach.slot): this field defines the possible slot linkage. Slot linkage is a way to entangle some notation or 
	//  display features to the content of a given slot. You can specify here to which feature the slot should be linked, 
	//  via one of the following symbols: "none", "lyrics", "color", "noteheadadjust", "noteheadchar", "noteheadfont", "notesize". <br />

#define BACH_DOC_SCORE_SYNCOPATION
	// A syncopation can be either tied or merged, depending, respectively, if it is represented by two tied chords, or by a single (larger) chord,

    // are described below. For the two non-trivial algorithms some additional attributes may fine tune respelling properties: <br />
    // â¢ "selection" (int, default 0): toggles the ability to operate on selection only (also works for default algorithm); <br />
    // â¢ "voicewise" (int, default 1): toggles the ability to respell one voice at a time; <br />
    // â¢ "sharpest" (symbol/pitch, default: B#): sets the "sharpest" note available (the farthest right on the line of fifths); <br />
    // â¢ "flattest" (symbol/pitch, default: Fb): sets the "flattest" note available (the farthest left on the line of fifths); <br />
    // â¢ "verbose" (int, default: 0): toggle a verbose mode (mostly for debug). <br />
    // The algorithms characteristics are the following ones:
    // - Default algorithm ("default"): just respell the notes according to the current key and enharmonicity tables. <br />
    // - Chew and Chen algorithm ("chewandchen"): implements the algorithm provided by Chew and Chen in the article
    // "Determining Context-Defining Windows: Pitch Spelling using the Spiral Array". Additional parameters, defined via message attributes,

    //   â¢ "winsize" (double, default: 500): window size in milliseconds; <br />
    //   â¢ "spiralr" (double, default: sqrt(2)): spiral radius; <br />
    //   â¢ "spiralh" (double, default: sqrt(15)): spiral vertical step (i.e. the distance parallel to the axis of the helix corresponding
    // to one step along the spiral array; <br />
    //   â¢ "numsliding" (int, default: 8): number of sliding windows; <br />
    //   â¢ "numselfreferential" (int, default: 2): number of self referential windows (see article); <br />
    //   â¢ "locality" (double, default: 0.5): a value of 1 only takes self-referential window into account, a value of 0 only takes global context
    // into account; any number in between will result in a linear combination of the two (this is the parameter <m>f</m> of the Chew and Chen article); <br />
    // - Atonal algorithm ("atonal"): respell the notes in a tree-like fashion (closest ones first), optimizing their position on the line of fifths. <br />
    //   â¢ "discardalteredrepetitions" (int, default: 1): discard solutions having subsequent repetitions of the same diatonic
    // step with different alterations (e.g. F#4 F4, or Bb5 B5); <br />
    //   â¢ "stdevthresh" (llll/symbol, default: 21/(numnotes+1)): sets a formula for a maximum standard deviation that the group of notes

#define BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_DIATONIC_INTERVALS_SYNTAX
	// A diatonic interval is by default characterized by a couple of integer numbers (list form of diatonic intervals): the width of the interval
	// in diatonic steps, and the width of the interval in chromatic steps. The number of diatonic steps in an octave
	// is always 7, while the number of chromatic steps depends on the modulo; by default, in the semitonal system, it is 12.
	// In such system, for instance, an ascending major third will be represented by <b>2 4</b>, since we need 2 diatonic steps 
	// and 4 chromatic steps to get from the bottom to the top note. As further examples, the interval between C5 and D#5 is <b>1 3</b>,
	// and the interval between E#4 and Fb5 is <b>8 11</b>. <br />
	// You can usually specify the diatonic interval also by directly inputting the width of the interval in midicents.

	// "simplest" one: 700 is a major fifth, 300 is a minor third (and not an augmented second), and so on.

#define BACH_DOC_DYNAMICS_SPECTRUM
    // The dynamics spectrum is the sequence of standard dynamics in the piano-to-forte range.
    // It is characterized by its "maxchars", i.e. the maximum number of p's and f's of the elements it contains ("mp" and "mf"
    // are considered as having 0 p's and f's).
    // For instance, the collection of
    // {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"} makes for a spectrum of <m>maxchars</m> = 2.
    // The "maxchars" property of the dynamic spectrum will factor into different conversions between dynamics and velocities,
    // in combination with a conversion exponent.
    // The dynamic range is set via the "maxchars" parameter, while the exponent is set via the "exp" parameter (greater than 0. and less or equal to 1.).
    // If "exp" is 1., the velocity range is divided linearly between the dynamics in the spectrum; otherwise an exponential scaling is applied.
    // Default exponent is 0.8, and default range width is 5 (from "pppp" to "ffff").
    // Any dynamic marking outside the spectrum will be clipped to the spectrum during conversion.
    // The dynamics are scaled so that "mp" will always correspond to velocity = 64.
    // If i is the index of the
    // If <m>i</m> is the 1-based index of the element of a spectrum containing 2D elements <br />
    // vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(-1+2i/(2D+1))*|-1+2i/(2D+1)|^a)/2)^b <br />
    // More clearly, once set x = x(i, D) = -1+2i/(2D+1), between -1 and 1, one has <br />
    // vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(x)*|x|^a)/2)^b. <br />
    // This function assumes values between 0. and 1., for x in [-1, 1].
    // In any case vel(i) is clipped to 127 (128 won't be allowed).
    // The parameter <m>a</m> is the "exp" parameter defined above. The parameter <m>b</m> is chosen so that vel("mp") = vel(D) = 64, which yields <br />
    // b = 1/(1 - log2(1 - 1/((2D+1)^a))) <br />
    // As an example, if "exp" (i.e. <m>a</m>) is 0.8 (hence <m>b</m> is about 0.745),
    // consider the spectrum {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 2 and <m>D</m> = 3 (containing <m>2D</m> = 6 elements).
    // The dynamics "f" has index 5, hence x = x(5, 3) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 10/7 = 3/7, hence <br />
    // vel("f") = vel(5) = 128 * ((1 + (3/7)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.810 ~ 103, <br />
    // while within the broader spectrum {"pppp", "ppp", "pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff", "fff", "ffff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 4 and <m>D</m> = 5,
    // one has x = x(7, 5) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 14/11 = 3/11

#define BACH_DOC_GOTO
    // The <m>goto</m> message moves the selection to new items, i.e. clears the selection and select the new item. <br />
    // The first argument is the go-to command, which can be one of the following symbols: <br />
    // â¢ "up", "down", "left", "right": move selection up/down/left/right, as you would with the editing
    // keyboard arrows (+ Command or Control) <br />
    // â¢ "next", "prev": move selection to the following or previous elements <br />
    // â¢ "time" or "timepoint": move selection to a given point in time (either in milliseconds or as a timepoint).
    // An argument is expected, either a number (millisecond position) or a timepoint, in llll form (see below for timepoint syntax). <br />
    // <br />
    // In addition, a certain number of behaviors can be changed via the following message attributes:
    // â¢ "repeat": expects an integer, setting the number of times for the command to be repeated. <br />
    // â¢ "nullmode": if non-zero, also notifies when there is no (longer) selection, e.g. at the end of a "next" go-to chain. <br />
    // â¢ "skiprests": if non-zero, avoids the rest while performing the selection. <br />
    // â¢ "inscreen": if non-zero, also puts the selected items inside the displayed portion of the domain. <br />
    // â¢ "voices": sets the voicenumbers for the voices to be accounted for; default is the empty llll, meaning: all voices. <br />
    // â¢ "where": sets a mathematical condition to be applied to sieve the selection each time the command is performed. Variables are the same
    // as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
    // â¢ "until": sets a mathematical condition that, if not matched, will cause the command to be re-executed, until the condition is met.
    // Variables are the same as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
    // â¢ "untilmode": a symbol, either "any" or "all", determining whether the <m>until</m> condition should be applied to all selected elements in order
    // to be considered met, or to anyone of them (i.e. at least one). <br />
    // â¢ "type": sets a list of notation item types (as symbols) to be accounted for, among: "note", "rest", "marker", "tempo", "measure", "voice". <br />
    // â¢ "markershavevoices": if non-zero, considers measure-attached markers as belonging to the corresponding voice (and hence accounts for it
    // while using the <m>voicemode</m> and <m>voices</m> message attributes). <br />
    // â¢ "graceshavedur": if non-zero, considers grace notes as having a (minimal) duration, precisely the one attributed to them by the <o>bach.score</o>
    // playback system, and controllable via the related attributes. <br />
    // â¢ "tiemode": one of the following symbols, defining how selection behaves with respect to ties: <br />
    //   - "each": each element in a tie sequence is independent, and can be independently selected; <br />
    //   - "all" (default): whenever an element in a tie sequence is to be selected, all the other elements are selected too. <br />
    // <br />
    // For the "time" command only: <br />
    // â¢ "include": for the "time" command only: expects one or two symbols among "head" and "tail" in order to determine what extreme should be included
    // when it falls exactly on the timepoint (default: head). <br />
    // For the "next"/"prev" commands only: <br />
    // â¢ "voicemode": a symbol determining how the selection should be performed across different voices. Allowed values are: <br />
    //   - "each": go-to command is performed in each voice independently (e.g.: all voices go to next selected chord, independently); <br />
    //   - "any": go-to command is performed on the next/previous element, no matter in which voice it is. The sequence will walk through all
    // chords in all voices; <br />
    //   - "all": go-to command is performed accounting for selection in all voices, but selection is allowed to always jump, starting from the
    // last reached onset or tail; <br />
    //   - "anyactive" (default): like "any", but only applied on the voices having some selected element; <br />
    //   - "allactive": like "all", but only applied on the voices having some selected element. <br />
    // â¢ "polymode": a symbol determining how the polyphony should be handled. Allowed values are: <br />
    //   - "none": don't account for polyphony, i.e. don't "hold" (keep selected) previously selected chords; <br />
    //   - "overlap" (default): keep previously selected chords if they overlap with the new selection. This yields a standard walkthrough of the score; <br />
    //   - "overhang": keep previously selected chords if they are "temporally contained" in the new selection (i.e. if the new selection starts before
    // their onset and ends after their tail). <br />
    // â¢ "from", "to": symbols (among "auto", "head" and "tail") determining from and to which point the selection should be computed.
    // For instance going to the "next" chord from a given selection means, by default, looking at the farthermost selected notehead
    // and searching for the first chords
    // whose notehead lies after that, i.e. we search from a head to another head. The opposite is true, by default, when going to "prev" chords:
    // we search from the leftmost tail the nearest previous one. This is the behavior with "from" and "to" attributes set to "auto".
    // One could change these behaviors by setting "from" and "to" explicitly to some other element ("head" or "tail"). <br />

#define BACH_DOC_OUT
//    The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
//    <m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
//    <m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
//  To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
//  except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
//  representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
//  "null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
//  are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
//    <m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
//  It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
//  limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
//  from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
//    <m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
//    <m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
//    The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
//  Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

#define BACH_DOC_MINDEPTH
//  <m>mindepth</m> sets the minimum depth level at which the operation must be performed.

#define BACH_DOC_ITERATIONMODE
//  <m>iterationmode</m> sets the behavior of the object when lllls of different length are iterated against each other.

//    If set to 1, operation will stop at the end of the longest llll.

#define BACH_DOC_LLLL_COMPARISON
// The comparison is performed as follows:
// the two lllls are traversed in parallel, and at each step an element of the first one is compared to an element of the second one.
// As soon as the two considered elements are different, the value of their comparison is the value of the comparison of the lllls.
// If the end of either list is reached, the longer is the greater.<br />
// Elements are compared as follows: numbers are compared by value;
// symbols are compared alphabetically (or, to be more precise, in lexicographical order according to the ASCII code);
// lllls are compared recursively as explained above; numbers are less than symbols; symbols are less than lllls.
// <br /> <br />

#define BACH_DOC_DEPTHREJECT
// When set to 1, the search depth range set through the <m>mindepth</m> and <m>maxdepth</m> attributes is inverted,
// meaning that the specified depth range is excluded from the search, rather than included.

#define BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_BASIC
// An address is an llll providing a unique representation of the position of an element in another llll.
// It is a concept shared by many bach object.
// The address of each element of an llll's root level is simply its position counting from 1.
// The address of an element in a sublist is a list composed by the position of the element in the sublist,
// preceded by the position of the sublist in the parent llll,
// and so on up to the root level, as a sort of "path" to the element.<br />
// For instance, given the llll <b>a b c [d e [f g] h i] j k</b> the position of <b>c</b> is <b>3</b>;
// the position of <b>[d e [f g] h i]</b> is <b>4</b>;
// the position if <b>e</b> is <b>4 2</b> since to reach it it takes to go to the 4th element of the root level, which is a sublist,
// and to the 2nd element of that sublist.
// By reading the address from right to left, it can be seen that this is equivalent to saying
// that the pointed element is the 2nd of the 4th.
// Likewise, in the above llll <b>f</b> has the address <b>4 3 1</b> since it is the 1st of the 3rd of the 4th.<br />

#define BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_NEGATIVE
// In addition, addresses sent to bach objects can contain negative positions,
// that is positions counted from the end of the llll instead than the right.
// Negative and positive positions can be safely mixed within a single address.
// Thus, the address of the element <b>g</b> can be expressed as <b>4 3 2</b> as well as <b>4 3 -1</b> or <b>-3 -3 -1</b>.<br />

#define BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_MULTIPLE
// <b>_NAME</b> also accepts a special syntax to indicate multiple elements of one level of the llll:
// a sublist in the address will be interpreted as a sequence of elements in the corresponding level.
// In this way, the address <b>4 [2 4 5]</b> means "the 2nd, 4th and 5th of the 4th", that is <b>e h i</b>.
// Negative positions are accepted here as well.
// Any number after the multiple-element sublist in the address llll is ignored.<br />

#define BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_RANGE
// The multiple-element sublist can contain sublists in its turn. These are called "range sublists".
// A range sublist is composed by two positions, and indicates all the elements comprised between these two positions.
// Either or both positions of a range sublist can be negative.
// So, the address <b> 4 [[2 -1] 1]</b> means "From the 2nd to the last (i.e. the 1st from the right) and the 1st of the 4th",
// that is <b>e [f g] h i d</b>.
// As a tip, notice that to retrieve all the contents of a sublist (as opposed to the sublist itself)
// the range (1 -1) can be specified.
