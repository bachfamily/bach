/*
 iterate on lists, according to the modes (see bach.iter's help files)
 if you provide it a cache, it will only do one step, and put the result in the cache.
 in this case, it will return 0 if the list is over, 1 otherwise.
 The functions are called back once for every input llll at every step (unless the case in which no element has to be output), with:
 - datax/addressx/cmdx/lambdax as their first argument (most often, you will want to pass your calling object)
 - list is the index of the llll we're currently referring
 - llll is a newly-created (and owned by llll_iter) llll, which contains the currently iterated element
 - cmd is the command (again, see the bach.iter's help file)
 - lambdafn is a callback function that is called everytime a new subll is going to be entered. See below for details. Can also be NULL.
 if one of those function returns non-zero, the iteration stop.

 ABOUT lambdafn:
 the callback function is passed void* (typically the calling object), array of lllls, and an array of elements, and an array of addresses, all of size <lists>.

 -    the elements are the elements we're about to enter.
    they can hold an H_LLLL atom, of which the contained llll is going to be entered. at least one H_LLLL atom is always present.
    or a non-H_LLLL atom, in which case a virtual sublist is about to be created, and the atom is going to be iterated against the other sublists.
    or an element can be NULL, which means that all the elements of its containing llll have already been iterated.
    You can check out each element's parent llll.
 -    the addresses are actually lllls, each containing the address of the element about to be entered.
 the callback function should return 0 to prevent the sublists from being entered, 1 to allow them
 IMPORTANT: you can't perform destructive operations, nor output from the outlets, the data you receive from the callback function.
 If you need to, clone them first!
 
 NB that this is only useful in very specific cases, 
 usually involving synchronization of many iterations, and/or complex interaction with other objects
 currently, it is used by bach.iter, bach.expr and bach.step
 You will usually want to iterate through a list with a for cycle
 if you want to iterate depth-first, you are advised to take advantage of the stack structure and API we provide,
 rather than adopting a recursive approach that would be noticeably slower and memory-hungry.
 Or, even better, you can call llll_funall()
 For an example of stack-based depth-first iteration, see e.g. llll_clone() (there's plenty of examples around)
 Actually, llll_iter internally is based on the same approach

 You can alter the contents of the hatoms passed to fn,

 Moreover, you can't modify or output the address passed to fn (but of course you can output/modify a clone of it).
 
 flags: see e_llll_funall_flags,
 If sublists != 0, before entering a sublist the hatom containing the sublist itself is output.
 If fn returns non-0, the sublist will not be entered.
 This applies to the main llll as well: a temporary hatom is created, containing it, and the iteration is not performed if fn returns non-0.
 When the main llll is output, address is an empty llll
 
 * How can you alter the llll structure?
 When a sublist is output, you can alter its contents as you like from within your callback function before returning control to llll_funall,
