/*
 The llll data structure:
 a doubly-linked list containing llllelems (see above: t_llllelem),
 with a notion for its place in the structure.
 This allows you to find the parent llll (via my_llll->l_owner->l_parent).
 If you manually tweak the contents of your llll, you must be sure that the ownerships and parenthoods are correctly maintained.
 If you do it with the API functions, they are generally maintained for you.
 The llll also has a notion of depth, which is automatically maintained if you manage the list via its API functions.
 But if you directly tweak the fields of the list, you have to take care that the depth is correctly updated.
 The functions llll_upgrade_depth() and llll_downgrade_depth() may help with this in most cases.
 
 To obtain a valid, empty llll, use llll_get()
 To convert a Max message or a string in an llll, use llll_parse() or llll_parse_with_leveltypes()
 To increment or decrement the reference count for an llll, use llll_retain() or llll_release(). If the count reaches 0, the llll is freed.
 There is also llll_free(), which is actually the same as llll_release().
 All this lifecycle stuff involves an object pool maintained by bach, 
 and memory claimed for lllls or llllelems is never really freed.
 To check for memory leaks, send the message [;bach poolstatus] and look at the Max window. 
 If there is no open patch containing llll-compatible objects,
 llll_current_phonebook_idx and llllelem_current_phonebook_idx should both be 0. If not, something has not been freed.
 In general, don't worry about llll_pool_size and llllelem_pool_size.
 
 When you free an llll, every llllelem it contains is freed unless OBJ_FLAG_DATA is set.
 This happens recursively, so in the standard case freeing a llll also frees all its sublists and its sublist's sublists and so on.
 
 Other useful functions for managing the lifecycle of lllls are:
 llll_chuck() (frees an llll but not the elements it contains: when possible, this should be preferred to setting OBJ_FLAG_DATA)
 llll_clear() (frees all the elements contained in an llll, but not the llll itself)
