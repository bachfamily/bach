	@description
	Turns a generic <o>bach.roll</o> (possibly containing overlapping notes) 
	into a monophonic one, by trimming the note tails if needed.
	
	@discussion
	<o>bach.mono</o> might be useful, for instance, 
	as a preparation for quantization tasks.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Function depends on inlet
// @description An llll in the first inlet is considered as the 
// gathered syntax of the <o>bach.roll</o> to be made monophonic,
// which is usually obtained via <o>bach.roll</o>'s <m>dump</m> message 
// (refer to it for more explainations). Such <o>bach.roll</o> is made
// monophonic, and the gathered syntax of the monophonic <o>bach.roll</o> is
// output from the outlet (ready to be connected with the left inlet
// of a <o>bach.roll</o>). <br />
// An llll in the second inlet is considered to be a list of 0's and 1's, one
// element for each voice, with 0 meaning: voice must not be made monophonic, and 
// 1 meaning: voice must be made monophonic. If no such list is provided, 
// all voices are made monophonic (default). If less integers than the number
// of voices are given, the last one is padded.

// @method bang @digest Output result
// @description Performs the operation on the most recently received input lllls.
