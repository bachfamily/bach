	@description
	Outputs one or more of random elements, extracted from a given urn llll,
	without repeating them.
	
	@discussion
	Nonetheless, if elements are repeated inside the urn llll, such repetition can remain
	in the extracted elements.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set urn llll
// @description An llll in the second inlet is considered to be the urn llll, from which elements
// are extracted (also depending on the <m>maxdepth</m> attribute).

// @method int @digest Set the number of elements to be picked at once
// @description An integer in the third inlet sets the number of elements that will be picked each time
// a bang is received (default: 1). Elements cannot be repeated while picking (if you 
// want to allow repetitions, have a look at <o>bach.random</o> instead), unless the urn llll
// itself has repeated elements.

// @method bang @digest Output randomly picked elements, without duplicates
// @description The given number of elements are randomly picked and output (from the first outlet)
// along with their addresses (from the second outlet). Elements having already been picked will
// not be picked anew (unless a <m>clear</m> message is explicitly sent, or the <m>llll</m> is sent anew,
// or the <m>autoclear</m> attribute is set to 1). When all elements have been picked from
// the urn, a bang is sent through the third outlet (unless the <m>autoclear</m> attribute is set to 1):
// in this case, the output llll might me shorter than expected, or even <m>null</m>. <br />
// @copy BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_BASIC

// @method seed @digest Set the random number generator seed
// @description Use the <m>seed</m> message to set the random number generator seed 
// (see the reference of <o>urn</o> for more information).
// @marg 1 @name seed @optional 0 @type int

// @method clear @digest Clears the urn
// @description Use the <m>clear</m> message to reset the urn, so that any of its elements can be picked at the
// next request.
