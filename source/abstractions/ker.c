	Find the kernel of a matrix
	
	@description
	Finds the kernel of an incoming matrix, 
	i.e. the set of vectors which are sent to 0 by the matrix multiplication.

	@discussion
	<o>bach.ker</o> finds the subspace of the vectors x such that Ax = 0, where 
	A is the incoming matrix. If a matrix is m x n, its kernel is a subspace 
	in n-dimensional euclidean space. Such subspace is defined by one of its
	basis, which is indeed output. <br /> <br />

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Output kernel of incoming matrix
// @description The kernel is output as a basis for it (a minimal list of
// spanning vectors), listed "by rows" (so a list of lists, each of the latter
// being one vector). A <b>null</b> is output if kernel is empty.<br />
// @copy BACH_DOC_MATRIXCALCULUS_MATRIX

// @method bang @digest Output kernel
// @description Outputs the kernel of the most recently input matrix (if any).
