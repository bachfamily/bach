	Find complement of a pitch-class set
	
	@description
	Given a pitch-class set, <o>bach.compl</o> 
	finds its complement, i.e. the set of all the numbers not appearing in the given set.

	bach.compl accepts in input also a complex tree of pitch-class sets, and will output the complementary
	accordingly (preserving the tree shape).
	For instance, with modulo = 12, the complement of the set [4 7 9] is [0 1 2 3 5 6 8 10 11].

// METHODS

// @method llll @digest Compute the complement of incoming pitch-class set
// @description In the first inlet, a pitch-class set, in the form of plain list of numbers (or a tree of such pitch-class sets)
// will trigger the output of its complement 

// @method bang @digest Find and output the complement
// @description Finds the complement of the most recently received input pitch-class set.

// @method int @digest Set modulo 
// @description An integer in the right inlet will set the modulo. <br />
// @copy BACH_DOC_SETTHEORY_MODULO

}


// INLETS

// @in 0 @type llll @digest Pitch-class set (as a plain list) or tree of pitch-clas sets.
