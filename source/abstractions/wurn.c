	Pick weighted random elements from an llll without duplicates
	
	@description
	Outputs one or more random elements, extracted from a given urn llll,
	without repeating them, depending on given probability weights.
	
	@discussion
	Nonetheless, if elements are repeated inside the urn llll, such repetition can remain
	in the extracted elements.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set urn llll or weights llll
// @description An llll in the second inlet is considered to be the urn llll, from which elements
// are extracted (also depending on the <m>maxdepth</m> attribute). <br />
// When an llll comes through the third inlet, this is considered to be the llll containing the probability weights,
// according to which elements of the pool llll will be picked. More specifically: elements will be picked
// with a probability directly proportional to their weight. In order for everything to work properly, the weights 
// llll should have the correct shape, according to the <m>maxdepth</m>. If <m>maxdepth</m> is 1 (default), the
// weights must be a plain llll having the same length of the urn llll.

// @method int @digest Set the number of elements to be picked at once
// @description An integer in the fourth inlet sets the number of elements that will be picked each time
// a bang is received (default: 1). Elements cannot be repeated while picking (if you 
// want to allow repetitions, have a look at <o>bach.wrandom</o> instead), unless the urn llll
// itself has repeated elements.

// @method bang @digest Output randomly picked elements, without duplicates
// @description The given number of elements are randomly picked and output (from the first outlet)
// along with their addresses (from the second outlet). Elements having already been picked will
// not be picked anew (unless a <m>clear</m> message is explicitly sent, or the <m>llll</m> is sent anew,
// or the <m>autoclear</m> attribute is set to 1). When all elements have been picked from
// the urn, a bang is sent through the third outlet (unless the <m>autoclear</m> attribute is set to 1):
// in this case, the output llll might me shorter than expected, or even <m>null</m>. <br />
// @copy BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_BASIC

// @method clear @digest Clears the urn
// @description Use the <m>clear</m> message to reset the urn, so that any of its elements can be picked at the
// next request.
