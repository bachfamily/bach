	Accepts in its left inlet an llll of pitches, in its right inlet an llll ties,
	and properly reverses the tie sequence.<br />
	
	@discussion
	<o>bach.tierev</o> accepts either a chord-wise sequence of pitches and ties, 
	or a voice-wise lllls of chords. It won't accept measure-syntaxed lllls: if you want to use it
	on more than one measure, make use of <o>bach.beatunbox</o>.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set reference pitches or ties llll, output result
// @description An llll in the first inlet is considered as the llll containing pitches (in midicents),
// and will reverse the ties llll and output the result. <br />
// An llll in the second inlet is considered as the llll containing tie information, structured exactly
// as pitches llll (1 for notes starting a tie, 0 otherwise). Such ties llll will be the one to be
// reversed and output when the reference pitches llll is received in the first inlet. <br />
// The two lllls must have the same structure, and can either be chord-wise lllls (one list for each chord, 
// one element for each note), or voice-wise lllls (one list for each voice, one list for each chord,
// one element for each note).

// @method bang @digest Reverse the ties llll
// @description Performs the operation on most recently received input lllls.
