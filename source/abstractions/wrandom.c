	@discussion
	When the weights are left <b>null</b> or are all left equal (uniform picking), this is

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set pool llll or weights llll, output randomly picked elements
// @description When an llll comes through the first inlet, <o>bach.random</o> sets it as the pool from which elements
// should be picked (also depending on the <m>maxdepth</m> attribute), 
// and then output the random elements (first outlet), along with their addresses
// (second outlet). <br />
// When an llll comes through the second inlet, this is considered to be the llll containing the probability weights,
// according to which elements of the pool llll will be picked. More specifically: elements will be picked
// with a probability directly proportional to their weight. In order for everything to work properly, the weights 
// llll should have the correct shape, according to the <m>maxdepth</m>. If <m>maxdepth</m> is 1 (default), the
// weights must be a plain llll having the same length of the pool llll.

// @method int @digest Set the number of elements to be picked at once
// @description An integer in the third inlet sets the number of elements that will be picked each time
// an llll or a bang is received (default: 1). Elements can be repeated while picking: if you don't
// want this behavior have a look at <o>bach.wurn</o> instead.

// @method bang @digest Output randomly picked elements
// @description The given number of elements are randomly picked and output (from the first outlet)
// along with their addresses (from the second outlet). <br />
