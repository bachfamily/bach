// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Combine incoming voices and output result
// @description <o>bach.combinevoices</o> expects a list of bach.roll's or bach.score's gathered-syntax
// dump, each wrapped in a level of parenthesis (for instance, by using <o>bach.join</o> with <m>inwrap</m> 1).
// Once it receives such list, it combines all the voices of the received objects into a new bach.roll
// or bach.score, listing all the voices one by one, in the intput order. <br />
// If you don't want all the voices of some bach.roll or bach.score to be considered,
// you can use the <m>subroll</m> or <m>subscore</m> messages instead of the simple <m>dump</m>.

// @method bang @digest Combine voices
// @description Combines the most recently received input lllls.
