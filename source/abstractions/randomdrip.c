// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set pool llll or weights llll
// @description When an llll comes through the third inlet, it is set as the pool from which elements
// should be picked (also depending on the <m>maxdepth</m> attribute). <br />
// When an llll comes through the fourth inlet, this is considered to be the llll containing the probability weights,
// according to which elements of the pool llll will be picked. More specifically: elements will be picked
// with a probability directly proportional to their weight. In order for everything to work properly, the weights 
// llll should have the correct shape, according to the <m>maxdepth</m>. If <m>maxdepth</m> is 1 (default), the
// weights must be a plain llll having the same length of the pool llll.

// @method int @digest Turn dripping on/off or set the time interval
// @description Any number other than 0 in the first inlet starts the dripping: at the introduced interval,
// <o>bach.randomdrip</o> outputs the randomly picked elements (from the first outlet) along with their address (from
// the second outlet). If <m>0</m> is received in the first inlet, it stops the dripping (as for the <o>metro</o> object). <br />
// An integer in the second inlet sets or changes the 
// interval (in milliseconds) between two consecutively output elements. <br />
// @copy BACH_DOC_ADDRESS_BASIC

// @method float @digest Set the time interval
// @description A float in the second inlet sets or changes the 
// interval (in milliseconds) between two consecutively output elements.
