	Reverse the non-rest elements of an llll
	
	@description
	Accepts an llll to reverse, an llll of reference durations,
	and reverses only the elements of the left llll corresponding to non-negative elements in the 
	durations llll.<br />
	
	@discussion
	<o>bach.chordrev</o> is especially useful to reverse parameters like cents,
	velocities or extras, without affecting the elements corresponding to rests. <br />
	<o>bach.chordrev</o> also accepts lllls of depth 2, considering them to be a list for each voice,
	and operates accordingly.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Set llll or reference durations llll, output result
// @description An llll in the first inlet is considered as the llll containing the parameter data
// to be reversed: its elements situated in the same position of positive elements of the reference durations llll are thus 
// reversed and the result is output (unless the <m>triggers</m> attribute is set to 2). 
// The elements corresponding to negative durations are left untouched. <br />
// An llll in the second inlet sets the reference durations llll. If the <m>triggers</m> attribute
// is 2, it also triggers the output of the rotation. <br />
// The two lllls must have the same structure, and can either be plain lllls, or lists of plain
// lllls, in which case they are considered as being one list for each voice.

// @method bang @digest Reverse non-rest elements
// @description Performs the operation on most recently received input lllls.
