	Constraints each element of the incoming llll
	into a given numerical range, defined by a lower and 
	an upper boundary.
	
	@discussion
	Lower and upper boundaries must be coherent, namely
	the upper one must always be greater or equal to the smaller one
	(also element-wise, if any of them is a complex llll),
	otherwise the result might be inconsistent.

// ---------------
// METHODS
// ---------------

// @method llll @digest Clip lll, output result, set boundary
// @description An llll in the first inlet is taken as the llll
// to be clipped. Each element of such llll is constrained to lie
// inside the range defined by the lower and upper boundaries:
// if it is smaller than the lower boundary it is set to be the lower
// boundary, if it is bigger than the upper boundary it is set to
// be the upper boundary. The modified llll is then output through
// the outlet. <br />
// An llll in the second inlet sets the lower boundary,
// an llll in the third inlet sets the upper boundary.
// In case such lllls are plain numbers, the meaning is trivial: such
// numbers apply for all elements of the original llll, coming from the
// first inlet.
// In case any of the two lllls is a complex llll, it is assumed
// to be an element-wise boundary for the incoming llll, exactly
// as it happens for the inputs of <o>bach.maximum</o> and 
// <o>bach.minimum</o>.
// If any boundary llll is complex, and do not correspond in length with the original
// llll, the longer is always considered (and exceeding elements are trivially preserved).
// If single scalar elements are in the same position of complex lllls, such
// scalars apply for all elements of the corresponding llll. 


// @method number @digest Set boundary
// @description A number in the second inlet sets the lower boundary for each element
// of the llll.
// A number in the third inlet sets the upper boundary for each element
// of the llll.

// @method bang @digest Output result
// @description Performs and outputs the calculation on the most recently received input data.

// @description The optional first argument sets the initial upper boundary.
// If the boundary needs to be an llll (see <m>llll</m> message), such llll needs
