				In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,

				The function outputs an llll formatted as the incoming one, where each numeric
				element has been replaced by the nearest element in the choosen temperament.
				For instance, if the modulo is 12, the number 6020 would be snapped to the number 6000
				(precise midicents of middle C). The same number, with modulo = 48, would be snapped to 6025
				(one eighth-tone above). The temperament is defined by the tone division, set in the right inlet.
