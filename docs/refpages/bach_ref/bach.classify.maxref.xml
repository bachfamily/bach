			<description>
				A bang in the first inlet causes the result of classification of the most recently received llll to be output. <br />
				<br /> N.B.: The object is not aware of changes you make in the lambda loop.
				If you change the lambda loop, you might want to re-input the most recent llll rather than just sending a <m>bang</m>.

				Group equal elements
			</digest>
			<description>
				In first inlet: Equal elements are grouped from the llll, and the resulting llll is output, having one more parenthesis
				level than the original one (corresponding to each group of equal elements, i.e. to each class).
				If a lambda loop is present, couples of elements are output from the 2nd and 3rd outlets.
				If the two elements should considered equal (and as a consequence one of the two should be removed from the llll)
				the equality test should return 1 to <o>bach.classify</o>'s second inlet; otherwise, it should return 0.
				If a lambda loop is not present, the elements are tested for "standard" equality (as in <o>bach.eq</o>),
				according to the <m>matchtype</m> attribute.

				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format, e

	<discussion>
		A custom equality test can be provided through the lambda loop. <br />
		A certain number of bach objects are equipped with "lambda" inlets and outlets. These inlets and outlets -
		always the rightmost ones - serve the purpose of letting you define a function the object will base its behavior upon.
		Such function is indeed a patching loop: parameters are taken from the lambda outlet(s), processed, and the "result" is
		plugged in the lambda inlet(s). The type of function, and the corresponding expected result, depend on the object behavior;
		for instance, cycles modifying elements will expect as "result" the modified element; cycles testing for custom equalities will
		expect a 0/1 answer (0 meaning: not equal; 1 meaning: equal), as well as cycles testing custom inequalities and sorting (1 meaning: the two
		elements are in the correct order; 0 meaning: the order is wrong). Refer to each specific object to know more about it.
		With many objects, it is not mandatory to provide an evaluation cycle: if you don't, a default function will be used. <br />
		It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
		<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.
