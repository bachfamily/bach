			<description>
				An <m>llll</m> in the first inlet is the llll whose quantiles should be
				computed, and will trigger the calculation and output. <br />
				An <m>llll</m> in the second inlet is the llll whose elements are the quantile points
				(i.e. the list of <m>q</m>'s determining the <m>q</m> quantiles). For instance, if such
				list is <b>1/4 1/2 3/4</b>, the first 4-quantile, the median and the third 4-quantile are
				output once the left lllls comes in. Quantiles can be rational or floating point numbers. Alternatively, numbers
				can be substituted by a range-syntax lllls in the form <b>[<m>start_quantile</m> <m>end_quantile</m>]</b>;
				in this case what will be output are not the quantiles, rather the original llll filtered so that
				only numbers lying within the two quantiles will be kept (numbers equal to either one of the two quantile extremes
				are also kept).

				Absolute Mode
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggles the ability to interpret quantiles not as relative proportion, rather
				as absolute integer position in the list. For instance, 3 will mean "third element",
				and -4 "fourth element counted backwards", as for <o>bach.nth</o>. If <m>absolute</m> mode is active,
				asking for quantile points such as <b>[-4 -1]</b> will return essentially the four biggest numbers in
				the llll - except if the fourth biggest number has more than one occurrence in the list, in which case
				it will be returned as many times as the number of occurrences. In general, then, asking for a
				<b>[<m>M</m> <m>N</m>]</b> quantile region will not necessarily yield <m>N</m> - <m>M</m> + 1 values.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

			<description>
				If quantile points are defined in range syntax (see <m>llll</m>), the
				<m>sort</m> attribute toggles the ability to sort the output llll. By default, this attribute
				is 0, so that the output llll will not be sorted, only filtered.
