		Compute the adjugate of a matrix
	</digest>

	<description>
		Computes the adjugate (or the classical adjoint) of an incoming matrix,
		i.e. the transposed of the matrix whose entries are the cofactors of the incoming matrix.
		If such a matrix can't be computed (for instance for non-wellshaped or non-square matrices)
		a bang is output through the right outlet.

				The adjugate (or classical adjoint) of the incoming matrix is output. <br />
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>(1 0 0) (0 1 0) (0 0 1)</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
