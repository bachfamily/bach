				Convert pitch-classes to midicents

			<description>
				The function outputs an llll formatted as the incoming one, but containing the midicents
				value instead of each pitch-class. <br />
				The conversion is performed according to the introduced modulo, and to a given base note, which will
				correspond to the zero pitch-class. Any other (positive) pitch class will be placed above the base note.
				Nonstandard pitch-class numbers (below 0, or above the modulo) are also allowed, and will.
				The (nonstandard) pitch-class corresponding to the modulo will be placed exactly one octave above
				the base note. For instance, if modulo is 12, and the base note is 6000 (default), the pitch-class
				12 (which is nonstandard) will correspond to 7200; the (standard) pitch-class 1 will correspond to
				6100, and so on.
				<br /> <br />
				A pitch-class set is a plain collection of pitch-classes. A pitch class is nothing but the representative of a set of pitches.
				Traditionally, it corresponds to the concept of "note", once we abstract it from its octave.
				For instance, the semitonal framework (when the modulo is 12), all the C belong to the same pitch-class
				which will be named 0 = {..., C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, ...}. The pitch-class 1 will be the one containing all C#'s (or Db's); pitch-class
				2 will contain all D's, and so on. One will use to name pitch class numbers from 0 to the modulo - 1: indeed, with modulo = 12, pitch-class 12 will coincide
				with pitch-class 0 (it'll be the C one octave higher). One can thus think at pitch-classes as equally spaced points on a clock, and transposing
				means rotating them on the clock. A pitch class set is thus represented just by a plain list of pitch classes, such <b>0 4 7</b>, representing the
				C major chord. Notice that this coincides with any other representation such as <b>12 4 19</b> or <b>0 -8 -5</b>, but the canonical form, where numbers
				are from 0 to the modulo-1 is always preferred. Also for pitch-class sets the order of elements is immaterial, and thus
				<b>0 4 7</b> or <b>4 0 7</b> or <b>7 4 0</b> will all represent the same set.
				On the other hand a pitch-class (as an abstract concept) can be used to represent things other than pitches,
				as for instance temporal position in a rhythmic pattern (loop) having a certain number (the modulo) of equally spaced elements.
