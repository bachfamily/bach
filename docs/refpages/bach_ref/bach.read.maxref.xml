				Ignore Categories
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>ignore</m> attribute allows preventing certain categories
				of elements to be interpreted according to the usual bach syntax.
				Categories are expressed by letters, according to the following table:<br />
				- <b>L</b> stands for all the open and closed parens marking llll sublists:
				if this category is set, parens and symbols containing parens
				are read just as symbols, as if they were preceded by a backtick. <br />
				- <b>l</b> stands for open and closed parens marking llll sublists,
				only if they do not appear in a symbol of their own
				(i.e., with the <b>l</b> category set,
				<b>(</b> is interpreted as the beginning of a sublist,
				whereas <b>(1</b> is interpreted just as a plain symbol,
				as opposed to what would happen normally,
				when it would mark the beginning of a sublist
				whose first element is <b>1</b>). <br />
				- <b>r</b> stands for rationals. <br />
				- <b>p</b> stands for pitches. <br />
				- <b>e</b> stands for floating-point numbers in scientific notation. <br />
				- <b>s</b> stands for the special symbols <b>nil</b> and <b>null</b>. <br />
				- <b>b</b> causes symbols beginning with a backtick
				to be interpreted with the backtick included
				(e.g., the <b>`foo</b> symbol is read as it is, including the backtick,
				as opposed to what would happen normally, when it would be read as <b>foo</b>). <br />
				- <b>a</b> stands for ignoring all the above categories.
				If it is present alongside other specifiers (e.g., <b>alp</b>), it overrides them. <br />
				- <b>-</b> stands for no category, and it is the default.
				If it is present alongside other specifiers (e.g., <b>-p</b>), it is ignored. <br />
				For example, the <m>ignore</m> attribute could be set to <b>lp</b>,
				which would cause a file containing <b>( a001 Mahler(Bernstein).aif )</b>
				to be read as an llll containing a sublist, containing in turn the symbols <b>a001</b> and
				<b>Mahler(Bernstein).aif</b>.
				Without setting the <m>ignore</m> attribute, the same file would be interpreted
				as an llll containing a sublist containing the pitch <b>A1</b>,
				the symbol <b>Mahler</b>,
				a further sublist only containing the symbol <b>Bernstein</b>,
				and finally the symbol <b>.aif</b>. <br />
				As a final note, it should be remarked that symbols in double quotes
				are always interpreted literally: for example, the symbol
				<b>"Mahler (Bernstein).aif"</b> would be interpreted as the single symbol
				<b>Mahler (Bernstein).aif</b> even if the <m>ignore</m> attribute is not set.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format, e
