				Measureinfo in separate syntax.
			</digest>
			<description>
				See the <m>llll</m> method for more information.
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

			<description>
				The measureinfo in separate syntax
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.score</o>, Measureinfo are assigned measurewise (they are a propriety of measures): an llll for each voice, containing a specification
				for each measure is expected.  <br />
				Durations are assigned chordwise (they are symbolic durations: a propriety of chords, rather than notes):
				the separate syntax for durations will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each measure,
				possibly containing an llll for each rhythmic level (see below), containing a rational value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[[1/4 1/4 [[1/8 1/16] [1/32 1/32]] -1/4] [1/12 1/12 1/12 -3/4]] [[-1] [1/4 -3/4]]</b>.
				The symbol "t" is also accepted in input to tie a duration to the following one, e.g. <b>[[1/4 t 1/16 -3/16 -2/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, and if the <m>outputtiesindurationtree</m> is set to 1,
				such "t" symbols are also always output in the durations separate syntax.
				Grace chords are defined either by setting a rational duration of 0 (converted into 1/8 grace chords) or by setting
				a rhythmic level starting with a "g" symbol, which will thus contain all grace elements, e.g. <b>[[1/4 [g 1/8 1/16 1/16] 1/4 1/4 0 1/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, grace chords are output, in the durations gathered syntax,
				with the grace levels syntax, otherwise they are output as chords with 0 duration. <br />
				Cents, velocities, ties and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.score</o> (they propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice

				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />

				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />

				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a

				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance

				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />

				Extras
			</digest>
			<description>
				The extras in separate syntax.
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />

				Playout
			</digest>
			<description>
				Outlet sending information about elements being played, as well as query answers and notifications.
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				<m>6</m> is a 1/2 chord, <m>7</m> is a 1/1 chord, <m>8</m> is a 2/1 chord. Smaller values are diadic subdivisions: <m>4</m> is a 1/8 chord,
				<m>3</m> is a 1/16 chord, <m>2</m> is a 1/32 chord, <m>1</m> is a 1/64 chord. <br />

				<br />
				Adds a pitch breakpoint to each one of the selected notes.
				The breakpoint is given by three arguments: <br />
				- a float number between 0 and 1, setting the relative position of the pitch breakpoint
				with respect to the note duration line (0 being the note head, 1 being the note tail).
				0 and 1 should be avoided (since a notehead and notetail already exists for any note), so the
				values should be striclty greater than 0 and strictly less than 1. <br />
				- a number setting the pitch difference (in midicents) of the breakpoint with respect to the main
				note's pitch.
				- an optional slope parameter, between -1 and 1, setting the slope of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint
				(0 being linear, default).
				- an optional velocity parameter, between 1 and 127, but only if the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is active.

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>addmarker <m>&lt;float: position_ms&gt;</m> <m>&lt;llll: name_or_names&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>addmarker 2000 George</b>   <i>→ add an absolute-position marker named 'George' at 2s</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 2000 [Foo Fee Faa]</b>   <i>→ the same, with a complex llll name</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker cursor John</b>   <i>→ add an absolute-position marker named 'John' at the current playhead position</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker [4] John</b>   <i>→ add a measure-attached marker named John at beginning of measure 4 (1st voice)</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker [4 1/2] John</b>   <i>→ the same, after 1/2 of measure 4 (1st voice)</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker [3 4 1/2] John</b>   <i>→ the same, after 1/2 of measure 4 (3rd voice)</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>addmarker</m> adds a marker with a specified name at a specified position in the score.
				At least two arguments are needed: the position of the marker and the marker name, as symbol.
				The position of the marker is the first argument, and can be either a single floating point number, in which case it is taken as
				the marker onset, in milliseconds, and the marker is assigned as attached to absolute millisecond position, or a timepoint llll,
				in which case the marker is assigned as measure-attached to the point defined by the timepoint. <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For instance, <b>addmarker 1000 foo</b> adds a marker at 1000ms with the name "foo", while <b>addmarker [1 1/4 3] faa</b> adds a marker
				named "faa" at attached to the position: measure 1, onset 1/4, voice 3.
				If several names need to be associated to the marker, the symbol can be replaced by a list of symbols,
				for instance <b>addmarker 1000 [foo fee]</b>. If no names need to be associated to the marker, leave <b>[]</b> as
				name llll.

				Append a single measure
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>appendmeasure <m>[&lt;int/symbol/llll: voice_numbers&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;llll: measures&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>appendmeasure</b>   <i>→ append 1 empty measure to all voices</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasure 2 [[[8 8]] []]</b>   <i>→ append a blank 8/8 measure to voice 2</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasure all [[[8 8]] []]</b>   <i>→ append a blank 8/8 measure to all voices</i><br />

				• <b>appendmeasure [2 3] [[[[3 2] 8] []] [3/8 [6000 100]] [-1/4]] [[[5 8] []] [1/4 [5900 100]] [-3/4]]</b>   <i>→ append first measure to voice 2, second measure to voice 3</i><br />
				<br />
				An <m>appendmeasure</m> message will append a single measure to the existing ones.
				The message accepts a voice number as first argument, and the gathered syntax of the measure to add as second argument. <br />
				The voice number can also be an llll in the form <b>[<m>start_voice_num</m> <m>end_voice_num</m>]</b>, in which case the measure is
				appended to all voices from <m>start_voice_num</m> to <m>end_voice_num</m>; <m>voice_num</m> can also be the "all" symbol, in which case
				measure is appended to all voices. <br />
				The measure (second argument) is expected to be in gathered syntax (see below).
				If more than one voice is concerned, and if additional measures (in gathered syntax) are added after this second argument,
				measure are assigned in voice-wise fashion. If no measure gathered syntax is specified, an empty measure will be appended. <br />
				For instance, a valid message would be <b>appendmeasure [2 3] [[[[3 2] 8] []] [3/8 [6000 100]] [-1/4]] [[[5 8] []] [1/4 [5900 100]] [-3/4]]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>appendmeasures <m>[&lt;int/symbol/llll: voice_numbers&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: how_many&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;llll: voices&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>appendmeasures 5</b>   <i>→ append 5 empty measures to all voices</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasures all 5</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasures 2 5</b>   <i>→ append 5 empty measures to voice 2</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasures [2 4] 5</b>   <i>→ append 5 empty measures to voices 2 through 4</i><br />
				• <b>appendmeasures [[[[3 4] []] [1/4 [C4 100 0]] [2/4 [E4 100 0]]] [[[2 4] []] [2/4 [G4 100 0]]]] [[[[5 4] []] [-1] [1/4 [ C4 100 0]]]]</b>   <i>→ add some measures in gathered syntax (on element for each voice)</i><br />
				<br />
				An <m>appendmeasures</m> message will append one or more measures to the existing ones.
				If the message has no arguments, the separate parameters are supposed to have been inserted through the separate parameter inlets,
				and the <m>addmeasures</m> message will essentially act like a <m>bang</m> which in turns will preserve the existing content,
				and append the newly introduced measures. Refer to the <m>llll</m> message to know more about separate parameter syntax of the inlets.<br />
				If the message has a single integer argument <m>N</m>, <m>N</m> empty measures will be appended to all voices. <br />
				If the message has a two arguments <m>voice_num</m> and <m>N</m>, <m>N</m> measures will be appended to the specified voice; <m>voice_num</m>
				can also be an llll in the form <b>[<m>start_voice_num</m> <m>end_voice_num</m>]</b>, in which case measures are appended to all voices
				from <m>start_voice_num</m> to <m>end_voice_num</m>; finally <m>voice_num</m> can also be the "all" symbol, in which case
				measures are appended to all voices. <br />
				If the message has more complex llll arguments, these are supposed to be in llll form, exactly in in the same syntax as the whole <o>bach.score</o>
				gathered syntax (without header specification): one llll for each voice,
				containing one llll for each measure to add (in measure gathered syntax). If for a given voice
				you don't need to add any chord, just set a <b>[]</b> llll.
				In this case the message syntax becomes:
				<b>appendmeasures <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>,
				where each voice is an llll in voice gathered syntax.
				For instance, a valid message would be <b>appendmeasures [[[[3 4][]] [1/4 [7185. 100 0]] [1/4 [6450. 100 0]] [1/4 [7185 100 0]]]
				[[[4 4] []] [-1/4] [1/12 [5850. 100 0 1]] [1/6 [6300. 100 0 0] 2] [1/6 [6600. 100 0]] [1/12 [6600. 100 1]] [1/4 [6600. 100 0]]]]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASURE1</m> <m>MEASURE2</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>MEASURE</m> is an llll representing a measure in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Default velocity is 100, but the last one is padded if more chords than the input velocities are
				to be created. Default extras are no extras.

				Syntax: <b>ceilmeasures <m>[&lt;int: num_measures&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>ceilmeasures</b>   <i>→ Make all voice have the same number of measures</i><br />
				• <b>ceilmeasures 100</b>   <i>→ Pad all voices to have 100 measures</i><br />
				<br />
				The message <m>ceilmeasures</m> forces all voices have the same number of measures,

				If the voice have the same tempi and time signatures, this message force all voices to end together
				(otherwise this is not necessarily the case). <br />
				If an integer argument is provided, then all voices are padded so to have that number of measures.

				Syntax: <b>cents <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: velocity&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>cents 6000</b>   <i>→ change selected notes to middle C's</i><br />
				• <b>cents = 6000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>cents = cents * 1.2</b>   <i>→ stretch pitches</i><br />
				• <b>cents = "random[48, 73]*100"</b>   <i>→ assign pitch randomly</i><br />
				• <b>cents = 6000 + [cents % 1200]</b>   <i>→ collapse to middle octave</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>cents</m>, followed by a number, sets the new pitch, in midicents, for all
				the selected notation items.
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded. <br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				Any of the numbers in the cents syntax can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing cents.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Modify the measureinfo of selected measures
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>cents <m>&lt;llll: measureinfo&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>measureinfo [5 4]</b>   <i>→ change selected measures' time signature to 5/4</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [5 4] [1/4 120]</b>   <i>→ the same, but also add quarter = 120 tempo</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [5 4] [[1/4 120] [1/4 160 1/2]]</b>   <i>→ the same, but also define a quarter = 160 tempo after 1/2 from the measure beginning</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [5 4] [[1/4 120 0 1] [1/4 160 1/2]]</b>   <i>→ the same, with accelerando</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [[3 2 2] 8]</b>   <i>→ change time signature to 3+2+2/8</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [[3 2 2] 8] [[1/4 120] [1/4 180 1/2]]</b>   <i>→ the same, but also add two tempi inside the measure</i><br />
				• <b>measureinfo [11 8] [boxes 3/8 2/8 3/8 4/8]</b>   <i>→ change time signature to 11/8 and assign custom 3+2+3+4 boxes</i><br />
				<br />
				Modifies the measureinfo of select measures. The expected syntax is the standard measureinfo syntax,
				without the outermost level of parentheses (e.g. <b>measureinfo [4 4] [3/8 120]</b> is a valid message). <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				<br />
				A <m>changeslotitem</m> message will change a specific element inside a slot (possibly containing more than one element, such as
				a <m>function</m> slot, or an <m>intlist</m> slot...) of any selected note.
				The syntax is <b>changeslotitem <m>slot_number</m> <m>element_index</m> <m>SLOT_ELEMENT_CONTENT</m></b>. <br />
				Instead of the slot number, you can use slot names, or you can the word "active" to refer to the currently open slot.
				The <m>element_index</m> is the number identifying the position of the element to be changed (e.g., for a <m>function</m> slot: 1 for the first point, 2 for the second, and so on).
				The symbol "all" can replace the element index, in order to change all elements.
				The element content is a single element in the lists of the slot content syntax: a single point for a slot <m>function</m>, a single number for an <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> slot,
				and so on. Such element must be unwrapped from its outer level of parentheses (if any). For instance, for a function,
				a good syntax is <b>changeslotitem 2 3 0.5 20 0</b> which will change the 3rd point of the function contained in the second slot
				to the point <b>[0.5 20 0]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.

				- <b>cents</b>: only dump the pitches in MIDIcents form (in separate syntax) from the third outlet
				(this overrides the <m>outputpitchesseparate</m>, forcing the output to be in Cents), <br />
				- <b>pitches</b>: only dump the pitches as diatonic pitches (in separate syntax) from the third outlet
				(this overrides the <m>outputpitchesseparate</m>, forcing the output to be always diatonic pitches), <br />
				- <b>durations</b>: only dump the durations (in separate syntax) from the fourth outlet. <br />
				- <b>velocities</b>: only dump the velocities (in separate syntax) from the fifth outlet. <br />
				- <b>ties</b>: only dump the velocities (in separate syntax) from the fifth outlet. <br />
				- <b>extras</b>: only dump the extras (in separate syntax) from the sixth outlet. <br />
				- <b>score</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.score</o> gathered syntax from the first outlet (and nothing from the separate parameters outlets). <br />
				- <b>body</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.score</o> gathered syntax from the first outlet, and drop all the header specifications: only dump the
				body (content) of the <o>bach.score</o>. <br />
				- <b>header</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.score</o> from the first outlet, dropping all the content (body) specification, and only
				outputting all the header specification. <br />
				Moreover, if one needs to only dump specific header elements, the <m>dump</m> message may also accept a list of symbols referring to them.
				Namely, the possibilities are the following ones: "keys", "clefs", "voicenames", "midichannels", "markers", "slotinfo", "command".
				Also the "body" symbol can always be added, in order to also dump the music content.
				For instance, <b>dump keys slotinfo voicenames</b> will dump the key signatures, the slotinfo and the voicenames,
				while, <b>dump keys slotinfo voicenames body</b> will do the same but will also output the music content (body).
				The order of the dumped elements does not correspond in general to the order of the symbols in the list.
				<br /> <br />
				The gathered syntax of a whole <o>bach.score</o> is in the form <b>score <m>HEADER</m> <m>BODY</m></b>, where
				the first symbol is optional as input (but always given as output). <m>HEADER</m> is an llll containing all the
				<o>bach.score</o> meta-information (such as key signatures, clefs, markers...),
				while <m>BODY</m> has the form of a sequence of voices: <b>[<m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...]</b>
				where each voice is an llll in gathered syntax (see below for more information about this). <br /> <br />
				The header contains meta-information about the score. Such information is given in the form <b>[<m>HEADER_LLLL1</m> <m>HEADER_LLLL2</m>...]</b>
				where each <m>HEADER_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>header_element_name</m> <m>CONTENT</m>]</b>. The complete list of header element names
				and the expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>clefs</b>: introduces the used clefs; one clef symbol for each voice is expected. The number of voices is automatically
				updated to the number of clef symbols inserted.
				Since clefs can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>clefs</m> attribute.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>keys</b>: introduces the used key signatures; one key signature symbol for each voice is expected. If less are given, last one is padded.
				Since key signatures can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>keys</m> attribute.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>voicenames</b>: introduces the voice names specification, one name (atom) for each voice is expected.
				If a voice have more than one name, an llll with the list of names must be introduced. To skip names for a voice use <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b>.
				Since voice names can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>voicenames</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>midichannels</b>: introduces the MIDI channels specification, one integer for each voice is expected.
				Since MIDI channels can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>midichannels</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>stafflines</b>: set the staff lines configurations. A list of elements (one for each voice) is expected. Since staff lines can be set both as header element and
				as attribute, also see the <m>stafflines</m> attribute. Each element can be in one of the following forms:
				either <b><m>number_of_stafflines</m></b>, setting the number of stafflines for the voice, which will be distributed evenly around
				the middle line of the default staff, or a wrapped llll in the form <b>[<m>index_staff_line1</m> <m>index_staff_line2</m>...]</b>
				where each index is the position of a line to be drawn. Line 1 correspond to the bottommost staffline of a standard staff;
				line 5 correspond to the topmost staffline of a standard staff. Integers need not be positive: indices like -2 or 7 will be
				extrapolated from the standard staff. The total number of lines is thus the length of such llll.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>markers</b>: specifies the markers. A list of elements (one for each marker) is expected. For <o>bach.roll</o> markers, or for
				<o>bach.score</o> markers attached to milliseconds position, each element
				must be in the form <b>[<m>position_ms</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m> <m>role</m> <m>content</m>]</b> where the two last parameters
				are optional and only supported by <o>bach.roll</o> (ignore them in <o>bach.score</o>). The <m>position_ms</m> is a floating number
				specifying the marker position in milliseconds; the <m>marker_name(s)</m> is either a single symbol, or a wrapped llll, or
				<b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if marker has no name. For <o>bach.score</o> measure-attached markers the syntax is: <b>[<m>TIMEPOINT</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m>]</b>
				where <m>TIMEPOINT</m> identifies a time point.
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>slotinfo</b>: specifies the information about the types and the global characteristics of each slot.
				The general syntax for a slotinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[slotinfo [<m>slot_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>slot_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>,
				where the <m>slot_num</m> are the slot numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding slotinfo specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the slot numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the slotinfo
				is always output for all slots, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the slotinfo.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>name</b>: expects the name you want to give to the slot (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>type</b>: expects one of the following symbols, defining the slot type: "function", "int", "float", "intlist", "floatlist", "text",
				"filelist", "llll", "spat", "togglematrix", "intmatrix", "floatmatrix", "filter, "dynfilter", "color", "3dfunction",
				"articulations", "notehead, "dynamics", "none".  <br />
				- <b>access</b>: sets the slot accessibility, and expects a symbol. Default is "readandwrite" (slot is readable and writable);
				you can also use "readonly" (slot is only readable, not writable via interface), or "none" (slot window can't even be opened, slot
				content cannot be accessed).<br />
				- <b>temporalmode</b>: sets whether the slot contains temporal information, and if so in which form.
				It expects one of the following symbols: "none" (the information is not temporal), "relative" (the information is temporal, and the X value
				of each slot item is a relative position inside the note duration, usually between 0 and 1), "milliseconds" (the information is temporal, and the X
				value of each slot item is defined as a position milliseconds with respect to the note onset). <br />
				- <b>extend</b>: toggles the ability for temporal slots to extend their content beyond the end of each corresponding note (might be also useful,
				in combination with the "milliseconds" temporalmode, in order to define continuous parameters, independently from a note duration). <br />
				– <b>range</b>: followed by two numbers, sets the minimum and maximum values the slot range (vertical axis for function and 3dfunction slots, or number
				range for number slots) may assume. <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				– <b>slope</b>: expects a parameter (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially represent the displayed range values of the slot. <br />
				– <b>width</b>: expects a value determining the width of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). <br />
				– <b>height</b>: a value determining the height of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). You can also put "auto"
				if you want to leave an automatically calculated height (default). <br />
				– <b>ysnap</b>: sets, for function or 3dfunction slots, some privileged Y points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Alt+mousedrag. <br />
				– <b>zsnap</b>: sets, for 3function slots, some privileged Z points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Ctrl+Alt+mousedrag (mac). <br />
				– <b>domain</b>: followed by two numbers, for function and 3dfunction slots, replaces the standard 0 to 1 domain with any input domain (input numbers
				are minimum and maximum). <br />
				– <b>domainslope</b>: a slope (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially rescale the domain display. <br />
				– <b>default</b>: a numeric value (for numeric slots) determining the slot default value. <br />
				– <b>representation</b>: it could expect one of the following things. 1: Symbols defining units of measurement (e.g. "Hz", "ms"...), for numeric
				slots one symbol is expected, for function slots if one symbol is given, it is applied to the Y axis, if two symbols are given they are
				applied to the X and Y axis, for 3dfunction slots up to three symbols can be given, the third one referring to the Z axis, use <b>nil</b> or
				<b>[]</b> to skip assignment for an axis. For filter and dynfilter slots, you can assign "Hz" or "cents" as unit of measurement
				and it will be used to display the cutoff frequency accordingly. 2: An enumeration list (only for int
				and intlist slots), mapping each integer to an element of this enumeration list (e.g. in an int slot from 1 to 3, a
				slot_representation "(one two three)" will display "one" at the place of 1, "two" at the place of 2, "three" at the place of 3).
				These symbols will never be output upon dump or play, they will be just displayed. 3:
				For matrix-typed slots, it can be either a llll containing the number of rows and columns, such as (3 4), or a llll containing
				the names of the rows and columns, such as ((or fee foo) (col1 col2 col3)). To give units to different axes, just list them, such as: Hz dB.
				– <b>zrange</b>: as "range", but for the Z spatial dimension (used by the 3dfunction slot: the Z dimension is the one "coming out" from the screen). <br />
				– <b>zslope</b>: as "slope", but for the Z spatial dimention (used by the 3dfunction slot). <br />
				– <b>singleslotfortiednotes</b>: (for bach.score only) tells whether tied sequences of notes have just one slot, the one corresponding
				to the first note of the sequence. <br />
				– <b>copywhensplit</b>: tells whether this slot should be copied when a note is split into a sequence of multiple notes (e.g. via quantization). <br />
				- <b>follownotehead</b>: forces to automatically modify the value of the slot depending on the notehead trimming (useful if the slot
				value is something associated to the notehead, such as the starting point for reading a sample).<br />
				<br />
				You are not obliged to input all the fields: you can give as input only the required fields.
				Also at output, only the needed fields are given (e.g. the "zrange" is only output for 3dfunction slots, and so on).
				Setting an individual field for a given will not change any other field, unless the type is changed, in which case
				a conversion on all the slots is performed (if possible, i.e. if slots are compatible) otherwise the slot data of the given slot is lost.
				While converting slots, also some other fields may be changed to default values for the new slot type. <br />
				Some more fields can be set via the slotinfo. These fields are never retrieved when the slotinfo is queried via a
				<m>dump</m> message, since they correspond to standard attribute values of the notation object: <br />
				- <b>background</b>: this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to be constantly painted in the background or 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>bgslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>popup</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to show up in the note+popup+menu, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>popupmenuslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>rightclick</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one wants that the right click (or two-fingers tap) on a note head directly
				pops up the slot window of the current slot, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>rightclickslot</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>linkto</b> (except bach.slot): this field defines the possible slot linkage. Slot linkage is a way to entangle some notation or
				display features to the content of a given slot. You can specify here to which feature the slot should be linked,
				via one of the following symbols: "none", "lyrics", "color", "noteheadadjust", "noteheadchar", "noteheadfont", "notesize". <br />
				<br />
				– <b>commands</b>: specifies the information about the commands. A list of elements (one for each command) is expected.
				The general syntax for an llll defining commands in a notation object header is:
				<b>[commands [<m>command_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>command_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>
				where the <m>command_num1</m> are the command numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding command specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the command numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the commands
				are always output for all commands, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the commands.
				The list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>note</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "note" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>chord</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "chord" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>rest</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "rest" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>groups</b>: (<o>bach.roll</o> only) specifies the information about the grouped chords.
				Although bach.roll syntax, as everything in bach, is transparent (and you are thus allowed to modify any element),
				there are extremely few cases where you might need to set manually the group information in llll form.
				Usually, such information is only dealt with via the interface (i.e. by grouping and ungrouping things),
				and the group header element is only a way to embed or save such information with the object.
				Nevertheless, nothing in principle prevents you from setting groups via message. The syntax is the following one:
				<b>[groups <m>GROUP1</m> <m>GROUP2</m>...]</b>, where each <m>GROUP</m> is an llll having the syntax
				<b>[<m>ADDRESS_CHORD1</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD2</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD3</m>...]</b>, where each address llll identifies one of the
				chord inside the groups, via the following syntax: <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>,
				where the chord index is the position of the chord inside the sequence of chords of the voice (ordered by onsets).
				– <b>articulationinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined articulation.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION1</m> <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom articulation to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "myfermata"). <br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "myf"). <br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots. <br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "articulationsfont"). <br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation). <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications determine the characters used:
				– <b>mainchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the main articulation character (above notes). <br />
				– <b>flippedchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the flipped articulation character (below notes). <br />
				– <b>extchar</b>: symbol or unicode value of the articulation extension, if any (e.g.: the tilde in a trill line). <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom:
				– <b>mainxshift</b>, <b>mainyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the main character (positive y shift moves up). <br />
				– <b>flippedxshift</b>, <b>flippedyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the flipped character. <br />
				– <b>mainheight</b>, <b>flippedheight</b>: height of the main and flipped characters. <br />
				– <b>mainycenter</b>, <b>flippedycenter</b>: position of the vertical center of the articulation for main and flipped char. <br />
				– <b>outsidestaffynudge</b>: additional y shift to push articulation farther from staff. <br />
				– <b>extyshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the articulation extensions. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will set the markings used when exporting articulations to MusicXML format:
				– <b>xmlornament</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML ornament whenever the articulation is found, or "none" if no export needed (default). <br />
				– <b>xmltechnical</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML technical tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-technical" type, defining a custom technical tag.<br />
				– <b>xmlarticulations</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML articulation tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-articulation" type, defining a custom articulation tag.<br />
				<br />
				Finally, one can assign an option specification, possibly followed by a list of symbols, to set some flags.
				Symbols must be among the following ones:<br />
				· <b>avoidlines</b>: avoid staff lines.<br />
				· <b>outsidestaff</b>: always place outside staff.<br />
				· <b>centerovernote</b>: center over the notehead.<br />
				· <b>centeroverstem</b>: center over the stem.<br />
				· <b>spanties</b>: articulation extension spans sequences of tied notes.<br />
				· copywhencloned: copy articulation while copying notes.<br />
				· copywhenclonedtosamechord: copy articulation while copying notes, and also when copying notes into the same chord.<br />
				· copywhensplit: copy articulation to all notes when notes are split, or retranscribed as tied sequences.<br />
				· shiftwithbeams: shift vertically according to beams.<br />
				<br />
				– <b>noteheadinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined noteheads.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD1</m> <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom notehead to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "curly").<br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "cr").<br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots.<br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "notationfont").<br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation).<br />
				– <b>char</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the notehead character. If two values are input, they refer respectively to the "black" and "white" flavours
				(assigned <o>bach.score</o> to black and white notes). If three values are input, they refer respectively to "black", "white" and "whole note" flavours.
				If four values are input they refer respectively to "black", "white", "whole note" and "double whole note". <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom: <br />
				– <b>xshift</b>: horizontal shift (positive values move right). <br />
				– <b>yshift</b>: vertical shift (positive values move up). <br />
				– <b>width</b>: the width of the notehead. <br />
				– <b>xshiftsmall</b>: same as xshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>yshiftsmall</b>: same as yshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>dlstartxshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the duration line. <br />
				<br />
				– <b>numparts</b>: specifies the information about the part assignment (see <m>numparts</m> attribute).
				– <b>loop</b>: specifies the information about the loop, as for the <m>loop</m> attribute, as a starting and ending point (in milliseconds, or as timepoints).
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASURE1</m> <m>MEASURE2</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>MEASURE</m> is an llll representing a measure in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.score</o>, Measureinfo are assigned measurewise (they are a propriety of measures): an llll for each voice, containing a specification
				for each measure is expected.  <br />
				Durations are assigned chordwise (they are symbolic durations: a propriety of chords, rather than notes):
				the separate syntax for durations will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each measure,
				possibly containing an llll for each rhythmic level (see below), containing a rational value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[[1/4 1/4 [[1/8 1/16] [1/32 1/32]] -1/4] [1/12 1/12 1/12 -3/4]] [[-1] [1/4 -3/4]]</b>.
				The symbol "t" is also accepted in input to tie a duration to the following one, e.g. <b>[[1/4 t 1/16 -3/16 -2/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, and if the <m>outputtiesindurationtree</m> is set to 1,
				such "t" symbols are also always output in the durations separate syntax.
				Grace chords are defined either by setting a rational duration of 0 (converted into 1/8 grace chords) or by setting
				a rhythmic level starting with a "g" symbol, which will thus contain all grace elements, e.g. <b>[[1/4 [g 1/8 1/16 1/16] 1/4 1/4 0 1/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, grace chords are output, in the durations gathered syntax,
				with the grace levels syntax, otherwise they are output as chords with 0 duration. <br />
				Cents, velocities, ties and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.score</o> (they propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />
				<br /> <br />
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				The <m>dumpmeasurepixelpos</m> message retrieves the pixel position of any measure, and outputs it from the playout.
				The output answer has the syntax:
				<b>measurepixelpos <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll of the form:

				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@router</m> (llll, default: null): Sets a forced router to be used instead of the default one<br />
				<m>@start</m> (symbol, default: none): Sets a router used to mark the beginning of the dumping<br />
				<m>@end</m> (symbol, default: none): Sets a router used to mark the end of the dumping<br />
				<br />
				The <m>dumpselection</m> message sends the content of each one of selected notation items from the
				playout, in playout syntax (off-line play).
				You can safely rely on the fact that elements will be output ordered by onset. <br />
				If a "router" message attribute is set, then the standard router ("note", "chord", "rest") is replaced by the specified one;
				if the "router" attribute has length 3, the first symbol will be used for notes, the second one for chords, the third for rests. <br />
				Additional routers can be set to mark the beginning and the end of the dumping, via the message attributes <m>start</m>
				and <m>end</m>; these are both set to <b>none</b> by default, hence disabling the reporting of the beginning and end of
				the routing.
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

		<method name="dumpvoicepixelpos">
			<arg name="query_label" optional="1" type="llll" />
			<digest>
				Retrieve pixel position of every voice
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>dumpvoicepixelpos <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The <m>dumpvoicepixelpos</m> message retrieves the pixel position of any voices, and outputs it from the playout.
				The output answer has the syntax:
				<b>voicepixelpos <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll of the form
				<b>[<m>y_pixel_middleC</m> <m>y_pixel_bottom_staffline</m> <m>y-pixel_top_staffline</m>]</b>. The three values are: the vertical position
				in pixels of the middle C, and the bottommost and topmost staffline position (in pixels). <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

				A <m>dynamics2velocities</m> message will assign all the note velocities (and pitch breakpoint velocity,
				if <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> is non-zero), depending on the current dynamics and hairpins, for the whole score or - if
				"selection" is set as first argument, for the selected items only. The dynamics sequence considered is the one contained in the slot
				linked to dynamics, if any (see <m>linkdynamicstoslot</m>), or in another slot, if given as integer argument. <br />
				Unless explicit dynamic-velocity mapping is defined, a default mapping is used. Two message attributes handle such default mapping: <br />
				• the "maxchars" attribute sets the width of the dynamics spectrum; <br />
				• the "exp" attribute sets the exponent for the conversion. <br />
				The dynamics spectrum is the sequence of standard dynamics in the piano-to-forte range.
				It is characterized by its "maxchars", i.e. the maximum number of p's and f's of the elements it contains ("mp" and "mf"
				are considered as having 0 p's and f's).
				For instance, the collection of
				{"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"} makes for a spectrum of <m>maxchars</m> = 2.
				The "maxchars" property of the dynamic spectrum will factor into different conversions between dynamics and velocities,
				in combination with a conversion exponent.
				The dynamic range is set via the "maxchars" parameter, while the exponent is set via the "exp" parameter (greater than 0. and less or equal to 1.).
				If "exp" is 1., the velocity range is divided linearly between the dynamics in the spectrum; otherwise an exponential scaling is applied.
				Default exponent is 0.8, and default range width is 5 (from "pppp" to "ffff").
				Any dynamic marking outside the spectrum will be clipped to the spectrum during conversion.
				The dynamics are scaled so that "mp" will always correspond to velocity = 64.
				If i is the index of the
				If <m>i</m> is the 1-based index of the element of a spectrum containing 2D elements <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(-1+2i/(2D+1))*|-1+2i/(2D+1)|^a)/2)^b <br />
				More clearly, once set x = x(i, D) = -1+2i/(2D+1), between -1 and 1, one has <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(x)*|x|^a)/2)^b. <br />
				This function assumes values between 0. and 1., for x in [-1, 1].
				In any case vel(i) is clipped to 127 (128 won't be allowed).
				The parameter <m>a</m> is the "exp" parameter defined above. The parameter <m>b</m> is chosen so that vel("mp") = vel(D) = 64, which yields <br />
				b = 1/(1 - log2(1 - 1/((2D+1)^a))) <br />
				As an example, if "exp" (i.e. <m>a</m>) is 0.8 (hence <m>b</m> is about 0.745),
				consider the spectrum {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 2 and <m>D</m> = 3 (containing <m>2D</m> = 6 elements).
				The dynamics "f" has index 5, hence x = x(5, 3) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 10/7 = 3/7, hence <br />
				vel("f") = vel(5) = 128 * ((1 + (3/7)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.810 ~ 103, <br />
				while within the broader spectrum {"pppp", "ppp", "pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff", "fff", "ffff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 4 and <m>D</m> = 5,
				one has x = x(7, 5) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 14/11 = 3/11
				vel("f") = vel(7) = 128 * ((1 + (3/11)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.748 ~ 96. <br />
				Moreover, the "mapping" attribute defines a non-standard or more general mapping via an llll specification. Such parameter has syntax
				<b>[<m>dynamics1</m> <m>velocity1</m>] [<m>dynamics2</m> <m>velocity2</m>]</b>.
				You might also define a the dynamics association you want to drift from the default values; any other marking which does not show up in the
				mapping will be converted via the default conversion equation.

				Furthermore, some exporting specifications are available, and each has to be given as llll after the (optional) file name.
				Such lllls will be in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>specification_value</m>]</b>). Available specifications are: <br />
				- <b>velocity</b> (default: 0): if non-0, the velocity for each note will be exported as a MusicXML direction.
				This is not always desirable, as the direction itself will appear as an empty expression when
				imported, for instance, into a software like Finale. <br />
				- <b>directionslots</b> [default: <b>null</b>): if one or more slots numbers are specified, their contents will be converted
				into text and exported as generic text directions. You can use range syntax to specify slot ranges, such as <b>[7 10]</b> meaning from 7th to 10th slot. <br />
				- <b>dynamics</b>: if non-zero, dynamics are exported from the currently linked slot (see <m>linkdynamicstoslot</m>). <br />
				- <b>noteheads</b>: if non-zero, dynamics are exported from the currently linked slot (see <m>linknoteheadstoslot</m>). <br />
				- <b>articulations</b>: if non-zero, articulations are exported from the currently linked slot (see <m>linkarticulationstoslot</m>). <br />
				- <b>lyrics</b>: if non-zero, lyrics are exported from the currently linked slot (see <m>linklyricstoslot</m>). <br />
				- <b>parenthesizedquartertones</b> [default: <b>0</b>): export quarter tones as parenthesized versions of semitonal accidentals
				which are a quartertone lower. For instance, if you set this specification to 1, a quarter sharp will be exported as a parenthesized
				natural, a quarter flat will be exported as a parenthesized flat, and so on.
				This specification should be considered as a workaround to ease quartertone export to Finale or similar pieces of software.
				Please notice that music notation software with a good native support for quartertones
				(e.g. Sibelius or MuseScore) will import them correctly from bach, without any workaround (no need to specify anything).
				Things are more complex with software such Finale, whose quartertone support is more cumbersome.
				With the default settings, what Finale will do is changing the character for single accidentals in order to show quartertones
				accidentals when needed. This is something you might want to avoid, since editing your score from that point on becomes very
				difficult. What might be handy to do, with Finale, is to export quartertone accidentals as if they were parenthesized versions
				of the standard accidentals. You can easily map inside finale the parenthesized accidentals to the glyphs of
				quartertone accidentals, via your favorite quartertone accidental font. A parenthesized natural will be displayed as
				a quarter-sharp; a parenthesized sharp as a three-quarters-sharp, and so on. Everything, if parenthesized, will step up a
				quarter tone. Once you have set up your new Finale document in this way, you can use the <b>[parenthesizedquartertones 1]</b>
				specification in order to export quartertones in this way.

				Further message attributes are:
				• "inconsistent": value is expected to be 0 or 1, telling if the fixing should happen on inconsistent dynamics
				• "unnecessary": value is expected to be 0 or 1, telling if the fixing should happen on unnecessary dynamics

				Syntax: <b>getdomain <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The <m>getdomain</m> message forces <o>bach.score</o> to output from the playout the current domain,
				i.e. the portion of <o>bach.score</o> currently displayed inside the screen. The output information is both in milliseconds
				and in timepoints.
				The syntax of the output answer is: <b>domain <m>start_ms</m> <m>end_ms</m> <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where the
				two elements following the "domain" symbol are the starting and ending point of the domain in milliseconds,
				and each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll containing the information about the timepoints of each voice (i.e. at which measure and point in measure,
				for each voice, the domain starts and ends]: its syntax is: <b>[[<m>start_measure_number</m> <m>start_sym_onset</m>]
				[<m>end_measure_number</m> <m>end_sym_onset</m>] <m>total_sym_duration</m>]</b>, where <m>start_measure_number</m> is the measure number of the
				measure where the domain starts, and <m>start_sym_onset</m> is the symbolic onset (point inside the measure) at which the domain start happens;
				<m>end_measure_number</m> is the measure number of the
				measure where the domain end, and <m>end_sym_onset</m> is the symbolic onset (point inside the measure) at which the domain end happens;
				finally <m>total_sym_duration</m> is the global duration of the domain in symbolic units. <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.

				• "up", "down", "left", "right": move selection up/down/left/right, as you would with the editing
				keyboard arrows (+ Command or Control) <br />
				• "next", "prev": move selection to the following or previous elements <br />
				• "time" or "timepoint": move selection to a given point in time (either in milliseconds or as a timepoint).
				An argument is expected, either a number (millisecond position) or a timepoint, in llll form (see below for timepoint syntax). <br />
				<br />
				In addition, a certain number of behaviors can be changed via the following message attributes:
				• "repeat": expects an integer, setting the number of times for the command to be repeated. <br />
				• "nullmode": if non-zero, also notifies when there is no (longer) selection, e.g. at the end of a "next" go-to chain. <br />
				• "skiprests": if non-zero, avoids the rest while performing the selection. <br />
				• "inscreen": if non-zero, also puts the selected items inside the displayed portion of the domain. <br />
				• "voices": sets the voicenumbers for the voices to be accounted for; default is the empty llll, meaning: all voices. <br />
				• "where": sets a mathematical condition to be applied to sieve the selection each time the command is performed. Variables are the same
				as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
				• "until": sets a mathematical condition that, if not matched, will cause the command to be re-executed, until the condition is met.
				Variables are the same as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
				• "untilmode": a symbol, either "any" or "all", determining whether the <m>until</m> condition should be applied to all selected elements in order
				to be considered met, or to anyone of them (i.e. at least one). <br />
				• "type": sets a list of notation item types (as symbols) to be accounted for, among: "note", "rest", "marker", "tempo", "measure", "voice". <br />
				• "markershavevoices": if non-zero, considers measure-attached markers as belonging to the corresponding voice (and hence accounts for it
				while using the <m>voicemode</m> and <m>voices</m> message attributes). <br />
				• "graceshavedur": if non-zero, considers grace notes as having a (minimal) duration, precisely the one attributed to them by the <o>bach.score</o>
				playback system, and controllable via the related attributes. <br />
				• "tiemode": one of the following symbols, defining how selection behaves with respect to ties: <br />
				- "each": each element in a tie sequence is independent, and can be independently selected; <br />
				- "all" (default): whenever an element in a tie sequence is to be selected, all the other elements are selected too. <br />
				<br />
				For the "time" command only: <br />
				• "include": for the "time" command only: expects one or two symbols among "head" and "tail" in order to determine what extreme should be included
				when it falls exactly on the timepoint (default: head). <br />
				For the "next"/"prev" commands only: <br />
				• "voicemode": a symbol determining how the selection should be performed across different voices. Allowed values are: <br />
				- "each": go-to command is performed in each voice independently (e.g.: all voices go to next selected chord, independently); <br />
				- "any": go-to command is performed on the next/previous element, no matter in which voice it is. The sequence will walk through all
				chords in all voices; <br />
				- "all": go-to command is performed accounting for selection in all voices, but selection is allowed to always jump, starting from the
				last reached onset or tail; <br />
				- "anyactive" (default): like "any", but only applied on the voices having some selected element; <br />
				- "allactive": like "all", but only applied on the voices having some selected element. <br />
				• "polymode": a symbol determining how the polyphony should be handled. Allowed values are: <br />
				- "none": don't account for polyphony, i.e. don't "hold" (keep selected) previously selected chords; <br />
				- "overlap" (default): keep previously selected chords if they overlap with the new selection. This yields a standard walkthrough of the score; <br />
				- "overhang": keep previously selected chords if they are "temporally contained" in the new selection (i.e. if the new selection starts before
				their onset and ends after their tail). <br />
				• "from", "to": symbols (among "auto", "head" and "tail") determining from and to which point the selection should be computed.
				For instance going to the "next" chord from a given selection means, by default, looking at the farthermost selected notehead
				and searching for the first chords
				whose notehead lies after that, i.e. we search from a head to another head. The opposite is true, by default, when going to "prev" chords:
				we search from the leftmost tail the nearest previous one. This is the behavior with "from" and "to" attributes set to "auto".
				One could change these behaviors by setting "from" and "to" explicitly to some other element ("head" or "tail"). <br />
				<br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				<br />
				The message <m>inscreen</m> followed by a temporal position specified in milliseconds forces such

				The millisecond position can be replaced by a timepoint, or by the element name, or

				<br />
				An <m>insertmeasure</m> message will insert a single measure at a given score position.
				The message expects a voice number as first argument, the measure number for the insertion as second argument,
				and the gathered syntax of the measure to insert as third argument. <br />
				The voice number can also be an llll in the form <b>[<m>start_voice_num</m> <m>end_voice_num</m>]</b>, in which case the measure is
				inserted in all voices from <m>start_voice_num</m> to <m>end_voice_num</m>; <m>voice_num</m> can also be the "all" symbol, in which case
				the measure is inserted in all voices (default). <br />
				The measure number for insertion is the measure index the measure will have once inserted. This can be either positive or negative:
				negative numbers mean counting backwards from the score end (-1 = last measure, -2 = one-but-last measure, and so on). <br />
				The gathered syntax of the measure is the standard score gathered syntax for measures (see below).
				If more than one voice is concerned, and if additional measures (in gathered syntax) are added after this third argument,
				measure are assigned in voice-wise fashion. If no measure gathered syntax is specified, an empty measure will be isnerted.
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Syntax: <b>insertmeasures <m>[&lt;int/symbol/llll: voice_numbers&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: measure_position&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;llll: voices&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>insertmeasures 2 3 5</b>   <i>→ insert 5 empty measures at measure 3, voice 2 only</i><br />
				• <b>insertmeasures [2 4] 1 5</b>   <i>→ insert 5 empty measures at the beginning, voice 2 through 4</i><br />
				• <b>insertmeasures all -1 3</b>   <i>→ insert 3 empty measures at the end, for all voices</i><br />
				• <b>insertmeasures all -2 3</b>   <i>→ insert 3 empty measures before last measure, for all voices</i><br />
				• <b>insertmeasures 2 3 [[[[3 4] []] [1/4 [7185 100]] [1/4 [6450 100]] [1/4 [7185 100]]] [[[4 4] []] [-1/4 0] [1/12 [5850 100]] [1/6 [6300 100]] [1/6 [6600 100]] [1/12 [6600 100]] [1/4 [6600 100]]]]</b>   <i>→ insert given measures in voice 2, at measure 3</i><br />
				<br />
				An <m>insertmeasures</m> message will insert one or more measures at a given score position.
				The message expects a voice number as first argument, the measure number for the insertion as second argument,
				and either the number of (empty) measures to insert, or the gathered syntax of the measures to insert as third argument. <br />
				The voice number can also be an llll in the form <b>[<m>start_voice_num</m> <m>end_voice_num</m>]</b>, in which case the measure is
				inserted in all voices from <m>start_voice_num</m> to <m>end_voice_num</m>; <m>voice_num</m> can also be the "all" symbol, in which case
				the measure is inserted in all voices (default). <br />
				The measure number for insertion is the measure index the measure will have once inserted. This can be either positive or negative:
				negative numbers mean counting backwards from the score end (-1 = last measure, -2 = one-but-last measure, and so on). <br />
				If the third argument is an integer number <m>N</m>, <m>N</m> empty measures will be inserted at the given position.
				If it is an llll, it is supposed to be in the standard score gathered syntax form (one element for each voice). In this case the
				message syntax would become:
				<b>insertmeasures <m>voice_numbers</m> <m>measure_number_for_insertion</m> <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>,
				where each voice is an llll in voice gathered syntax.
				For instance, a valid message would be <b>insertmeasures 2 3 [[[[3 4] []] [1/4 [7185 100]] [1/4 [6450 100]] [1/4 [7185 100]]] [[[4 4] []]
				[-1/4 0] [1/12 [5850 100]] [1/6 [6300 100]] [1/6 [6600 100]] [1/12 [6600 100]] [1/4 [6600 100]]]]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASURE1</m> <m>MEASURE2</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>MEASURE</m> is an llll representing a measure in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASURE1</m> <m>MEASURE2</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>MEASURE</m> is an llll representing a measure in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				The <m>interp</m> message, followed by a time value (in milliseconds) retrieves
				the instantaneous data of all the notes which are active at the given time instant.
				The answer is sent through the playout in the following form: <b>interp <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>
				where each <m>VOICE</m> is in the form <b>[<m>CHORD</m>]</b>, being the chord active at the
				given time instant (if any, or null if none), with <m>CHORD</m> being in the form <b>[<m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>...]</b>,
				being the chord notes active at
				the given time instant, each in the standard note gathered syntax, with two important variations:
				there is no tie element, and for each slot marked as temporal only the slot element at the given time instant
				is output (e.g. the interpolated function point of a function slot). <br />
				If the <m>interp</m> message is followed by the <m>tempo</m> symbol, before any other argument, then the tempo
				is retrieved at the specified position in time, for every voice. <br />
				If the <m>interp</m> message is followed by the <m>timesig</m> symbol, before any other argument, then the time signature
				is retrieved at the specified position in time, for every voice. <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

			<description>
				In the first inlet, an llll is expected to be a gathered syntax content of the entire <o>bach.score</o> (building
				the new <o>bach.score</o> content from scratch), or an llll containing just some header specification
				(thus not affecting the body of the object). See below for more information on the gathered syntax. <br />
				In any of the other inlets, an llll is expected to contain the separate syntax of some parameter. Namely: <br />
				- second inlet: Measureinfo <br />
				- third inlet: Pitches or cents <br />
				- fourth inlet: Durations <br />
				- fifth inlet: Velocities <br />
				- sixth inlet: Ties <br />
				- seventh inlet: Extras <br />
				See below for more information about the separate syntax. Also see the <m>bang</m> method to rebuild content from these separate
				parameters.<br /> <br />
				The gathered syntax of a whole <o>bach.score</o> is in the form <b>score <m>HEADER</m> <m>BODY</m></b>, where
				the first symbol is optional as input (but always given as output). <m>HEADER</m> is an llll containing all the
				<o>bach.score</o> meta-information (such as key signatures, clefs, markers...),
				while <m>BODY</m> has the form of a sequence of voices: <b>[<m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...]</b>
				where each voice is an llll in gathered syntax (see below for more information about this). <br /> <br />
				The header contains meta-information about the score. Such information is given in the form <b>[<m>HEADER_LLLL1</m> <m>HEADER_LLLL2</m>...]</b>
				where each <m>HEADER_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>header_element_name</m> <m>CONTENT</m>]</b>. The complete list of header element names
				and the expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>clefs</b>: introduces the used clefs; one clef symbol for each voice is expected. The number of voices is automatically
				updated to the number of clef symbols inserted.
				Since clefs can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>clefs</m> attribute.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>keys</b>: introduces the used key signatures; one key signature symbol for each voice is expected. If less are given, last one is padded.
				Since key signatures can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>keys</m> attribute.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>voicenames</b>: introduces the voice names specification, one name (atom) for each voice is expected.
				If a voice have more than one name, an llll with the list of names must be introduced. To skip names for a voice use <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b>.
				Since voice names can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>voicenames</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>midichannels</b>: introduces the MIDI channels specification, one integer for each voice is expected.
				Since MIDI channels can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>midichannels</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>stafflines</b>: set the staff lines configurations. A list of elements (one for each voice) is expected. Since staff lines can be set both as header element and
				as attribute, also see the <m>stafflines</m> attribute. Each element can be in one of the following forms:
				either <b><m>number_of_stafflines</m></b>, setting the number of stafflines for the voice, which will be distributed evenly around
				the middle line of the default staff, or a wrapped llll in the form <b>[<m>index_staff_line1</m> <m>index_staff_line2</m>...]</b>
				where each index is the position of a line to be drawn. Line 1 correspond to the bottommost staffline of a standard staff;
				line 5 correspond to the topmost staffline of a standard staff. Integers need not be positive: indices like -2 or 7 will be
				extrapolated from the standard staff. The total number of lines is thus the length of such llll.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>markers</b>: specifies the markers. A list of elements (one for each marker) is expected. For <o>bach.roll</o> markers, or for
				<o>bach.score</o> markers attached to milliseconds position, each element
				must be in the form <b>[<m>position_ms</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m> <m>role</m> <m>content</m>]</b> where the two last parameters
				are optional and only supported by <o>bach.roll</o> (ignore them in <o>bach.score</o>). The <m>position_ms</m> is a floating number
				specifying the marker position in milliseconds; the <m>marker_name(s)</m> is either a single symbol, or a wrapped llll, or
				<b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if marker has no name. For <o>bach.score</o> measure-attached markers the syntax is: <b>[<m>TIMEPOINT</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m>]</b>
				where <m>TIMEPOINT</m> identifies a time point.
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>slotinfo</b>: specifies the information about the types and the global characteristics of each slot.
				The general syntax for a slotinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[slotinfo [<m>slot_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>slot_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>,
				where the <m>slot_num</m> are the slot numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding slotinfo specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the slot numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the slotinfo
				is always output for all slots, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the slotinfo.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>name</b>: expects the name you want to give to the slot (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>type</b>: expects one of the following symbols, defining the slot type: "function", "int", "float", "intlist", "floatlist", "text",
				"filelist", "llll", "spat", "togglematrix", "intmatrix", "floatmatrix", "filter, "dynfilter", "color", "3dfunction",
				"articulations", "notehead, "dynamics", "none".  <br />
				- <b>access</b>: sets the slot accessibility, and expects a symbol. Default is "readandwrite" (slot is readable and writable);
				you can also use "readonly" (slot is only readable, not writable via interface), or "none" (slot window can't even be opened, slot
				content cannot be accessed).<br />
				- <b>temporalmode</b>: sets whether the slot contains temporal information, and if so in which form.
				It expects one of the following symbols: "none" (the information is not temporal), "relative" (the information is temporal, and the X value
				of each slot item is a relative position inside the note duration, usually between 0 and 1), "milliseconds" (the information is temporal, and the X
				value of each slot item is defined as a position milliseconds with respect to the note onset). <br />
				- <b>extend</b>: toggles the ability for temporal slots to extend their content beyond the end of each corresponding note (might be also useful,
				in combination with the "milliseconds" temporalmode, in order to define continuous parameters, independently from a note duration). <br />
				– <b>range</b>: followed by two numbers, sets the minimum and maximum values the slot range (vertical axis for function and 3dfunction slots, or number
				range for number slots) may assume. <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				– <b>slope</b>: expects a parameter (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially represent the displayed range values of the slot. <br />
				– <b>width</b>: expects a value determining the width of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). <br />
				– <b>height</b>: a value determining the height of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). You can also put "auto"
				if you want to leave an automatically calculated height (default). <br />
				– <b>ysnap</b>: sets, for function or 3dfunction slots, some privileged Y points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Alt+mousedrag. <br />
				– <b>zsnap</b>: sets, for 3function slots, some privileged Z points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Ctrl+Alt+mousedrag (mac). <br />
				– <b>domain</b>: followed by two numbers, for function and 3dfunction slots, replaces the standard 0 to 1 domain with any input domain (input numbers
				are minimum and maximum). <br />
				– <b>domainslope</b>: a slope (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially rescale the domain display. <br />
				– <b>default</b>: a numeric value (for numeric slots) determining the slot default value. <br />
				– <b>representation</b>: it could expect one of the following things. 1: Symbols defining units of measurement (e.g. "Hz", "ms"...), for numeric
				slots one symbol is expected, for function slots if one symbol is given, it is applied to the Y axis, if two symbols are given they are
				applied to the X and Y axis, for 3dfunction slots up to three symbols can be given, the third one referring to the Z axis, use <b>nil</b> or
				<b>[]</b> to skip assignment for an axis. For filter and dynfilter slots, you can assign "Hz" or "cents" as unit of measurement
				and it will be used to display the cutoff frequency accordingly. 2: An enumeration list (only for int
				and intlist slots), mapping each integer to an element of this enumeration list (e.g. in an int slot from 1 to 3, a
				slot_representation "(one two three)" will display "one" at the place of 1, "two" at the place of 2, "three" at the place of 3).
				These symbols will never be output upon dump or play, they will be just displayed. 3:
				For matrix-typed slots, it can be either a llll containing the number of rows and columns, such as (3 4), or a llll containing
				the names of the rows and columns, such as ((or fee foo) (col1 col2 col3)). To give units to different axes, just list them, such as: Hz dB.
				– <b>zrange</b>: as "range", but for the Z spatial dimension (used by the 3dfunction slot: the Z dimension is the one "coming out" from the screen). <br />
				– <b>zslope</b>: as "slope", but for the Z spatial dimention (used by the 3dfunction slot). <br />
				– <b>singleslotfortiednotes</b>: (for bach.score only) tells whether tied sequences of notes have just one slot, the one corresponding
				to the first note of the sequence. <br />
				– <b>copywhensplit</b>: tells whether this slot should be copied when a note is split into a sequence of multiple notes (e.g. via quantization). <br />
				- <b>follownotehead</b>: forces to automatically modify the value of the slot depending on the notehead trimming (useful if the slot
				value is something associated to the notehead, such as the starting point for reading a sample).<br />
				<br />
				You are not obliged to input all the fields: you can give as input only the required fields.
				Also at output, only the needed fields are given (e.g. the "zrange" is only output for 3dfunction slots, and so on).
				Setting an individual field for a given will not change any other field, unless the type is changed, in which case
				a conversion on all the slots is performed (if possible, i.e. if slots are compatible) otherwise the slot data of the given slot is lost.
				While converting slots, also some other fields may be changed to default values for the new slot type. <br />
				Some more fields can be set via the slotinfo. These fields are never retrieved when the slotinfo is queried via a
				<m>dump</m> message, since they correspond to standard attribute values of the notation object: <br />
				- <b>background</b>: this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to be constantly painted in the background or 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>bgslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>popup</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to show up in the note+popup+menu, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>popupmenuslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>rightclick</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one wants that the right click (or two-fingers tap) on a note head directly
				pops up the slot window of the current slot, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>rightclickslot</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>linkto</b> (except bach.slot): this field defines the possible slot linkage. Slot linkage is a way to entangle some notation or
				display features to the content of a given slot. You can specify here to which feature the slot should be linked,
				via one of the following symbols: "none", "lyrics", "color", "noteheadadjust", "noteheadchar", "noteheadfont", "notesize". <br />
				<br />
				– <b>commands</b>: specifies the information about the commands. A list of elements (one for each command) is expected.
				The general syntax for an llll defining commands in a notation object header is:
				<b>[commands [<m>command_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>command_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>
				where the <m>command_num1</m> are the command numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding command specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the command numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the commands
				are always output for all commands, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the commands.
				The list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>note</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "note" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>chord</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "chord" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>rest</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "rest" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>groups</b>: (<o>bach.roll</o> only) specifies the information about the grouped chords.
				Although bach.roll syntax, as everything in bach, is transparent (and you are thus allowed to modify any element),
				there are extremely few cases where you might need to set manually the group information in llll form.
				Usually, such information is only dealt with via the interface (i.e. by grouping and ungrouping things),
				and the group header element is only a way to embed or save such information with the object.
				Nevertheless, nothing in principle prevents you from setting groups via message. The syntax is the following one:
				<b>[groups <m>GROUP1</m> <m>GROUP2</m>...]</b>, where each <m>GROUP</m> is an llll having the syntax
				<b>[<m>ADDRESS_CHORD1</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD2</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD3</m>...]</b>, where each address llll identifies one of the
				chord inside the groups, via the following syntax: <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>,
				where the chord index is the position of the chord inside the sequence of chords of the voice (ordered by onsets).
				– <b>articulationinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined articulation.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION1</m> <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom articulation to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "myfermata"). <br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "myf"). <br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots. <br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "articulationsfont"). <br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation). <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications determine the characters used:
				– <b>mainchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the main articulation character (above notes). <br />
				– <b>flippedchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the flipped articulation character (below notes). <br />
				– <b>extchar</b>: symbol or unicode value of the articulation extension, if any (e.g.: the tilde in a trill line). <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom:
				– <b>mainxshift</b>, <b>mainyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the main character (positive y shift moves up). <br />
				– <b>flippedxshift</b>, <b>flippedyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the flipped character. <br />
				– <b>mainheight</b>, <b>flippedheight</b>: height of the main and flipped characters. <br />
				– <b>mainycenter</b>, <b>flippedycenter</b>: position of the vertical center of the articulation for main and flipped char. <br />
				– <b>outsidestaffynudge</b>: additional y shift to push articulation farther from staff. <br />
				– <b>extyshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the articulation extensions. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will set the markings used when exporting articulations to MusicXML format:
				– <b>xmlornament</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML ornament whenever the articulation is found, or "none" if no export needed (default). <br />
				– <b>xmltechnical</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML technical tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-technical" type, defining a custom technical tag.<br />
				– <b>xmlarticulations</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML articulation tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-articulation" type, defining a custom articulation tag.<br />
				<br />
				Finally, one can assign an option specification, possibly followed by a list of symbols, to set some flags.
				Symbols must be among the following ones:<br />
				· <b>avoidlines</b>: avoid staff lines.<br />
				· <b>outsidestaff</b>: always place outside staff.<br />
				· <b>centerovernote</b>: center over the notehead.<br />
				· <b>centeroverstem</b>: center over the stem.<br />
				· <b>spanties</b>: articulation extension spans sequences of tied notes.<br />
				· copywhencloned: copy articulation while copying notes.<br />
				· copywhenclonedtosamechord: copy articulation while copying notes, and also when copying notes into the same chord.<br />
				· copywhensplit: copy articulation to all notes when notes are split, or retranscribed as tied sequences.<br />
				· shiftwithbeams: shift vertically according to beams.<br />
				<br />
				– <b>noteheadinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined noteheads.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD1</m> <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom notehead to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "curly").<br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "cr").<br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots.<br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "notationfont").<br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation).<br />
				– <b>char</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the notehead character. If two values are input, they refer respectively to the "black" and "white" flavours
				(assigned <o>bach.score</o> to black and white notes). If three values are input, they refer respectively to "black", "white" and "whole note" flavours.
				If four values are input they refer respectively to "black", "white", "whole note" and "double whole note". <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom: <br />
				– <b>xshift</b>: horizontal shift (positive values move right). <br />
				– <b>yshift</b>: vertical shift (positive values move up). <br />
				– <b>width</b>: the width of the notehead. <br />
				– <b>xshiftsmall</b>: same as xshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>yshiftsmall</b>: same as yshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>dlstartxshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the duration line. <br />
				<br />
				– <b>numparts</b>: specifies the information about the part assignment (see <m>numparts</m> attribute).
				– <b>loop</b>: specifies the information about the loop, as for the <m>loop</m> attribute, as a starting and ending point (in milliseconds, or as timepoints).
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASURE1</m> <m>MEASURE2</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>MEASURE</m> is an llll representing a measure in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any measure is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> <m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>MEASUREINFO</m> is the information concerning time signatures and tempi, as well as possibly other information regarding barlines, widths and more (see below),
				each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord and must be in the chord gathered syntax, and the <m>measure_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if measure is locked), 2 (if measure is muted), 4 (if measure is solo), 8 (if measure rhythmic tree is locked). <br />
				In the most general form, chord information is not represented linearly as a sequence of <m>CHORD</m> lllls, rather as a rhythmic tree, so
				chord lllls are in general wrapped into further levels of parentheses. This is not necessary as input, although you can define such levels
				also as input, in order to suggest to <o>bach.score</o> the rhythmic tree you want to have,
				for instance: <b>[<m>MEASUREINFO</m> [[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>] <m>CHORD3</m>]... <m>measure_flag</m>]</b>.
				These additional levels act as suggestions on the bach algorithms, which might create further levels (e.g. by refining levels) or modify the existing ones
				according to the <m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m> attributes.
				Each level llll by default has as first element, while output, an llll in the form <b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is a number
				which accounts for the "lifecycle" of the level (was it created by the user? was it refined by bach itself?...) and which should be
				opaque to the user: such level type should never be set by hand, only kept to guarantee a good storage or rebuilding of <o>bach.score</o>.
				The interpretation of rhythmic tree levels as input will depend on all the rhythmic tree attributes, the most important of which are
				<m>treehandling</m> and <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>. At output, the gathered syntax might or might not contain the rhythmic tree
				levels of parentheses, depending on the <m>outputtrees</m> attribute. Also it might or might not contain level type specifications,
				depending on the <m>saveleveltypes</m> attribute. <br />
				Grace chords are characterized by being elements inside grace levels. Grace levels are identified by a "g" symbol at the very beginning
				of the level. A grace level may contain sub-levels as any other ordinary level. Indeed, grace chords may have any symbolic duration,
				they may also be rests, or organized in tuplets. The general form of the grace level is thus <b>[g <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>CHORD_OR_CHORDS</m> may be a complex llll containing the gathered syntax of chords. For instance: <b>[g [1/8 [6000 127 1]] [[-1/12] [1/24 [6000 127 1]]]]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>sym_duration</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>sym_duration</m> is the symbolic rational duration of the chord, as a fraction of the whole note (e.g. <b>1/4</b>), each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have specifications defining its name(s) or its slots.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				and before the <m>chord_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[1/4 [7000. 127 1] [7200. 100 0] [name john] [slots [10 fermata]] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.score</o>, Measureinfo are assigned measurewise (they are a propriety of measures): an llll for each voice, containing a specification
				for each measure is expected.  <br />
				Durations are assigned chordwise (they are symbolic durations: a propriety of chords, rather than notes):
				the separate syntax for durations will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each measure,
				possibly containing an llll for each rhythmic level (see below), containing a rational value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[[1/4 1/4 [[1/8 1/16] [1/32 1/32]] -1/4] [1/12 1/12 1/12 -3/4]] [[-1] [1/4 -3/4]]</b>.
				The symbol "t" is also accepted in input to tie a duration to the following one, e.g. <b>[[1/4 t 1/16 -3/16 -2/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, and if the <m>outputtiesindurationtree</m> is set to 1,
				such "t" symbols are also always output in the durations separate syntax.
				Grace chords are defined either by setting a rational duration of 0 (converted into 1/8 grace chords) or by setting
				a rhythmic level starting with a "g" symbol, which will thus contain all grace elements, e.g. <b>[[1/4 [g 1/8 1/16 1/16] 1/4 1/4 0 1/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, grace chords are output, in the durations gathered syntax,
				with the grace levels syntax, otherwise they are output as chords with 0 duration. <br />
				Cents, velocities, ties and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.score</o> (they propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />
				<br /> <br />
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />

				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where

				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:

				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />

				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Syntax: <b>merge <m>[&lt;sym: selection&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;rational: threshold_time&gt;</m> <m>&lt;float: threshold_cents&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;int: time_merging_policy&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: pitch_merging_policy&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10</b>   <i>→ merge chords &lt;= 1/32 and notes whose distance is &lt;= 10cents</i><br />
				• <b>merge -1 10</b>   <i>→ just merge notes whose distance is &lt;= 10cents</i><br />
				• <b>merge selection 1/32 10</b>   <i>→ just merge elements if they are selected</i><br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10 -1</b>   <i>→ as the first example, but merge to the leftmost chord</i><br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10 1</b>   <i>→ as the first example, but merge to the rightmost chord</i><br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10 1 1</b>   <i>→ the same, but merge notes to the highest one</i><br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10 1 -1</b>   <i>→ the same, but merge notes to the lowest one</i><br />
				• <b>merge 1/32 10 0 -1</b>   <i>→ merge chords to the average and notes to the lowest one</i><br />
				<br />
				You can use the <m>merge</m> message to perform a merging of chords whose duration is too small,
				and/or of notes too near (with respect to the pitch). The two tasks are separate: the first implies that small chords will be deleted,
				and their duration will increase other chords' duration; the second implies that notes whose pitches differ by less then a pitch
				threshold will be merged to a single one. <br />
				Two arguments are needed for the "merge" command: the time threshold (in symbolic units, e.g.: <b>1/32</b> merges all the
				chords whose duration is less or equal to 1/32) and the pitch threshold (in cents).
				If any of the two threshold is set as negative, this means that there will be no corresponding merging: leave the time threshold as negative
				if you only want to merge in the pitch direction, leave the pitch threshold as negative if you only want to merge chords in the time coordinate. <br />
				Two additional optional arguments can be given specifying, respectively: the time merging policy (-1 = merge towards the left chord,
				0 = split small chord's duration between left and right chords, 1 = merge towards the right chord), the pitch merging policy (-1 = set pitch to the bottommost
				pitch, 0 = set pitch to the average of pitches, 1 = set pitch to the topmost pitch).
				The merging policies are optional parameters: if you don't specify them, by default they are 0 (= merge to the average). <br />
				If an optional "selection" symbol is put in front of the time threshold argument, the merging is performend only on the current selection,
				otherwise it is performed on the whole score.

				Examples:<br />
				• <b>name George</b>   <i>→ name selected elements as 'George'</i><br />
				• <b>name [George Martin] [George Harrison]</b>   <i>→ assign complex llll name</i><br />
				• <b>name George @progeny 1</b>   <i>→ if chords are selected also assign name to their notes</i><br />
				<br />
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@incremental</m> (int, default: 0): If non-zero, assigns incremental numbering to selected markers in addition to names<br />
				<m>@progeny</m> (int, default: 0): If non-zero, assigns names to both selected chords and all their notes<br />
				<br />
				The word <m>name</m>, followed by a symbol, a number or an llll, assigns such content as names for the
				selected notation items. <br />
				If markers are selected, an additional message attribute can be given in order to name them with an incremental naming system,
				keeping the first one of the introduced names, and then adding an integer as second name, so that the overall name is unique
				inside the <o>bach.roll</o>. The additional message attribute must be given in the form <b>@incremental 1</b>,
				to be appended at the end of the message. For instance <b>name foo @incremental 1</b> will name all selected elements as "foo",
				but will name all selected markers as "foo 1", "foo 2", and so on (unless one of such names was already taken, and thus it is skipped
				to guarantee the unicity). <br />
				If a <b>@progeny 1</b> attribute is added and chords are selected, not only the chord name is changed, but also the name of all its notes.
				This is handy for instance, if one needs to send <b>name @progeny 1</b> to delete all names of selected chords and notes.

			<digest>
				Modify the onset of selected markers
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>onset <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: onset&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>onset 1000</b>   <i>→ move selected markers to 1s</i><br />
				• <b>onset = 1000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>onset = onset + 1000</b>   <i>→ shift selected markers by 1s forward</i><br />
				• <b>onset = [index - 1] * 1000</b>   <i>→ space all markers by 1s</i><br />
				• <b>onset = "[pow[1.4, index] - 1]*1000"</b>   <i>→ the same, in rallentando</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>onset</m>, followed by a number, sets the new onset, in milliseconds, for all
				the selected markers or pitch breakpoints. This absolute onset can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the
				existing onset, or by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				of the overtype content. Notice that the timepoints also include the voices in which the overtype must occurr. <br />
				The second argument is indeed the content to be overtyped. This is assumed to be in the score gathered-syntax, but without any
				measure llll levels. Somehow, it is assumed to be an "unboxed" score content in gathered syntax, although rhythmic tree levels might
				also appear in such content. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				Pastes the content contained in the global clipboard. <br />
				If the clipboard contains some measures and the first argument is the "replace" symbol, the measure are pasted over the selected ones.
				If the clipboard contains some measures and the first argument is not the "replace" symbol, the copied measure are inserted, by default

				was copied, the slot content is applied only to the specified slot number. This number can be replaced with the "active" symbol, and the
				slot content will be applied to the open slot window. <br />
				Exactly analogously, a "slotinfo" symbol can be used instead of "slot", and if the clipboard contains slotinfo content, then

				Modify the pitch of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>pitch <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: pitch&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>pitch C5</b>   <i>→ change selected notes to middle C's</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = C5</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = pitch + D0</b>   <i>→ transpose by major second</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = pitch + Eb0</b>   <i>→ transpose by minor third</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = pitch - C1</b>   <i>→ transpose one octave down</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = [pitch % C1] + C5</b>   <i>→ collapse to middle octave</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>pitch</m>, followed by a pitch, sets the new pitch, in midicents, for all
				the selected notation items. Differently from <m>cents</m>, the <m>pitch</m> message preserve diatonic information.
				If a list of pitches is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded. <br /> <br />
				Any of the numbers in the pitch syntax can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing pitch.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Convert a pixel position into a time position

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>pixeltotime <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;float: pixel_position&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;symbol: snap_type&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>pixeltotime 300</b>   <i>→ get the timepoint corresponding to 300pixels</i><br />
				• <b>pixeltotime 300 interp</b>   <i>→ the same thing</i><br />
				• <b>pixeltotime 300 nearest</b>   <i>→ get the timepoint of the chord nearest to 300pixels</i><br />
				• <b>pixeltotime 300 left</b>   <i>→ the same, only for chords with position &lt;300pixels</i><br />
				• <b>pixeltotime 300 right</b>   <i>→ the same, only for chords with position &gt;300pixels</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>pixeltotime</m> message converts a position given in pixels (as argument) into a temporal position, output both in milliseconds and
				as timepoints, representing the time corresponding to the inserted pixel position.
				The output answer is sent through the playout, and its syntax is: <b>time <m>time_position_ms</m> <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where the
				two elements following the "timeatpixel" symbol are the starting and ending point of the hypotetical domain in milliseconds,
				and each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll containing the information about the timepoints of each voice (i.e. at which measure and point in measure,
				for each voice, fall on the introduced pixel): its syntax is: <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset</m>]</b>, where <m>measure_number</m> is the measure number of the
				measure where the pixel lies, and <m>sym_onset</m> is the symbolic onset (point inside the measure) to which the pixel correspond.
				If the pixel does not fall exactly on a chord, by default, the timepoints are output by properly interpolating the timepoints of the chords whose onset are
				immediately at left and at right of the pixels. On the other hand, one can modify this behavior by introducing a final symbol argument (the "snap" type), which can be one
				of the followings: <br />
				- <b>left</b>: always return the timepoint of the chord whose onset falls immediately at left of the inserted pixel. <br />
				- <b>right</b>: always return the timepoint of the chord whose onset falls immediately at right of the inserted pixel. <br />
				- <b>nearest</b>: return the timepoint of the chord whose onset falls immediately either at left or at right of the inserted pixel, depending on which onset is nearest to the pixel position. <br />
				- <b>interp</b> (default): interpolate between left and right chord (as explained above). <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

				• <b>play [3.5] [10]</b>   <i>→ play from half of measure 3 to beginning of measure 10 (i.e. end of measure 9)</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>play</m> message plays a portion or all the <o>bach.score</o>.
				"Playing" means that <o>bach.score</o> sends from the "playout" outlet, at the timing corresponding to each chord onset,
				the information about all the chord, or about all the notes of the chord (depending on the <m>playmode</m> attribute, to which you
				should refer to know more). Rests are sequenced if the <m>playrests</m> attribute is set to 1.
				Markers are sequenced if the <m>playmarkers</m> attribute is set to 1. Tempi are sequenced
				if the <m>playtempi</m> attribute is set to 1. Measure starting barlines (along with the corresponding measureinfo) are sequenced if
				the <m>playmeasures</m> attribute is set to 1. <br />
				The sequencing takes into account the solo and mute state of each element (see <m>solo</m>, <m>unsolo</m>, <m>mute</m> and <m>unmute</m> messages):
				if elements are muted, they will not be sequences; if some elements are set as "solo", just those elements will be sequenced.
				If multiple chords or notes are simultaneous, the order is from topmost voice to bottommost voice, then from lowest note to highest note.
				Sequencing can be controlled with a variable speed via the <m>clock</m> message and the <o>setclock</o> object.
				The <m>play</m> message, without any further argument, plays the <o>bach.score</o> from the current playhead cursor position
				(by default: the beginning of the <o>bach.score</o>) to the end. <br />
				If you put as first argument the "offset" symbol, all the playing will be done in non-real-time mode, i.e. with no sequencing involved; playing messages
				will be still output from the playout, but one after another, "immediately". <br />
				If you put as first argument the "preschedule" symbol, all the playing events will be prescheduled.
				Prescheduled playback schedules the events at the beginning of the playback, hence taking a bit more time before playback starts, but also ensuring
				ensures the best possible timing. Prescheduled playback has some limitations: <br />
				- no live modification to the roll or score is accounted for during playback; <br />
				- loops won't work;  <br />
				- lambda+modifications won't work;  <br />
				- redraw is only performed at each new event;  <br />
				- the "pause" message won't work.  <br />
				If you give a single numeric argument, it will be the starting point in milliseconds
				of the region to be played: <o>bach.roll</o> will play from that point to the end. If you give two numeric arguments, they will be the starting and
				ending point in milliseconds of the region to be played.
				Each one of such numbers can be replaced by a <o>bach.score</o> timepoint. <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				Syntax: <b>playselection <m>[&lt;symbol: scheduling_mode&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>playselection</b>   <i>→ play selected items only</i><br />
				• <b>playselection offline</b>   <i>→ the same, in non-realtime mode ("uzi-like")</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>playselection</m> message only plays the selected content. It works exactly like <m>play</m>, but it starts playing
				at the beginning of the selection, and ends playing at the end of the last selected item. Only selected items are sequenced.
				Mute and solo status are also taken into account (see <m>play</m>). <br />
				If you put as first argument the "offset" symbol, all the playing will be done in non-real-time mode, i.e. with no sequencing involved; playing messages
				will be still output from the playout, but one after another, "immediately", in the low-priority queue. <br />
				If you put as first argument the "preschedule" symbol, all the playing events will be prescheduled.
				Prescheduled playback schedules the events at the beginning of the playback, hence taking a bit more time before playback starts, but also ensuring
				ensures the best possible timing. Prescheduled playback has some limitations: <br />
				- no live modification to the roll or score is accounted for during playback; <br />
				- loops won't work;  <br />
				- lambda+modifications won't work;  <br />
				- redraw is only performed at each new event;  <br />
				- the "pause" message won't work.  <br />

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>poc <m>&lt;number/pitch/llll/anything: pitch_or_cents&gt;</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The word <m>poc</m> is an acronym for "pitch or cents", and will change either the pitch or the cents of the selected notes
				depending if the note has user-defined enharmonicities or not. If a note has user-defined enharmonicities, <m>poc</m> will

				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Reset measure width factors
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>resetwidthfactors <m>[&lt;int: start_measure_number&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: end_measure_number&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>resetwidthfactors</b>   <i>→ reset all width factors to 1</i><br />
				• <b>resetwidthfactors 10</b>   <i>→ reset width factors for measures from 10 to end</i><br />
				• <b>resetwidthfactors 5 10</b>   <i>→ reset width factors for measures from 5 through 10</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>resetwidthfactors</m> will revert all measure width factors to 1.
				Measure width factors are local width factors defined inside the measureinfo (see below) which alters the spacing width only for a given measure
				(To be more precise: they alter measure width for all the region of measures, throughout all voices, where the given measure is, and extended
				at left and at right until a synchronous barline is found in all voices. In standard cases, where voices have the same tempi and time signatures,
				this correspond to the vertical range of measures having the same number, in all voices.)
				A value of 1 corresponds to standard spacing, any lower values correspond
				to a compression, any higher values correspond to an expansion. The <m>resetwidthfactors</m> message revert such values to the 1 (default).
				If no arguments are given, width factors are reset for the entire score.
				If two arguments are given, they are expected to be integers, representing the measure numbers of the leftmost and rightmost
				measure whose width factors should be reset (in any voice).
				If just one argument is given, it is expected this represents the leftmost measure number, and the rightmost boundary is considered to be
				the end of the score. <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				The <m>respell</m> message reset the enharmonicity ("graphics") specification of each selected note to a default one.
				Three algorithms are available, which can be set using the "algorithm" message attribute: a default algorithm,
				the algorithm provided by Chew and Chen, and an algorithm targeting atonal diatonic behaviors. The three algorithms
				are described below. For the two non-trivial algorithms some additional attributes may fine tune respelling properties: <br />
				• "selection" (int, default 0): toggles the ability to operate on selection only (also works for default algorithm); <br />
				• "voicewise" (int, default 1): toggles the ability to respell one voice at a time; <br />
				• "sharpest" (symbol/pitch, default: B#): sets the "sharpest" note available (the farthest right on the line of fifths); <br />
				• "flattest" (symbol/pitch, default: Fb): sets the "flattest" note available (the farthest left on the line of fifths); <br />
				• "verbose" (int, default: 0): toggle a verbose mode (mostly for debug). <br />
				The algorithms characteristics are the following ones:
				- Default algorithm ("default"): just respell the notes according to the current key and enharmonicity tables. <br />
				- Chew and Chen algorithm ("chewandchen"): implements the algorithm provided by Chew and Chen in the article
				"Determining Context-Defining Windows: Pitch Spelling using the Spiral Array". Additional parameters, defined via message attributes,
				are: <br />
				• "winsize" (double, default: 500): window size in milliseconds; <br />
				• "spiralr" (double, default: sqrt(2)): spiral radius; <br />
				• "spiralh" (double, default: sqrt(15)): spiral vertical step (i.e. the distance parallel to the axis of the helix corresponding
				to one step along the spiral array; <br />
				• "numsliding" (int, default: 8): number of sliding windows; <br />
				• "numselfreferential" (int, default: 2): number of self referential windows (see article); <br />
				• "locality" (double, default: 0.5): a value of 1 only takes self-referential window into account, a value of 0 only takes global context
				into account; any number in between will result in a linear combination of the two (this is the parameter <m>f</m> of the Chew and Chen article); <br />
				- Atonal algorithm ("atonal"): respell the notes in a tree-like fashion (closest ones first), optimizing their position on the line of fifths. <br />
				• "discardalteredrepetitions" (int, default: 1): discard solutions having subsequent repetitions of the same diatonic
				step with different alterations (e.g. F#4 F4, or Bb5 B5); <br />
				• "stdevthresh" (llll/symbol, default: 21/(numnotes+1)): sets a formula for a maximum standard deviation that the group of notes
				being retranscribed must have (interpreted as their projection onto the line of fifths); <br />

				• <b>sample [2 0 1/2] timepoint</b>   <i>→ sample score at each half note, having as reference the second voice</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>sample</m> message, followed by a integer (the number of sampling points),
				samples the note data (exactly as <m>interp</m> does) throughout the score, at the (uniformly taken) sampling point.
				The answer is sent through the playout in the following form: <b>sample [<m>t1</m> <m>t2</m>...] [<m>RES1</m> <m>RES2</m>...]...</b>
				where each <m>t</m> is an instant in milliseconds, and each <m>RES</m> is the result of the <m>interp</m> message performed
				on such instant (see <m>interp</m> to know more). <br />
				If the <b>ms</b> symbol is given as second argument, the first numeric argument (which can also be non-integer, in
				this case) is considered to be the distance between samples (in milliseconds), and not the number of samples. <br />
				If the <b>timepoint</b> symbol is given as second argument, the first argument is expected to be an interval expressed in the
				timepoint syntax; the score will be sampled at multiples of such timepoint. For instance, a timepoint of <b>[1]</b> will sample
				the score at the beginning of each measure, while a timepoint of <b>[0 1/4]</b> will sample the score at each quarter note;
				a timepoint of <b>[4 0 1/4]</b> will sample the score at each quarter note, taking the fourth voice as "master" to consider
				the timepoints (which might be crucial if voices have different tempi or time signatures). If no voice number is specified, the
				voice having the most measures is considered. Extended timepoint syntax (with floating point numbers) is not supported. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				<m>@restseqmode</m> (int, default: each): If "all", sequences of consecutive rests are counted as one<br />
				<br />
				The word <m>sel</m> add some notation items to the current selection. In the basic behavior,
				the word must be followed by four elements, specifying: <br />
				- the starting temporal point of the selection, in milliseconds (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to select from the beginning); <br />
				- the ending temporal point of the selection, in milliseconds (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to select until the end); <br />
				- the minimum pitch of the selection, in cents (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you don't want to put a lower bound on pitches); <br />
				- the maximum pitch of the selection, in cents (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you don't want to put an upper bound on pitches). <br />
				Both the starting and the ending temporal point of the selection can be substituted by timepoints. <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				Other selection modes are possible: <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>all</b>, all notes, chords and markers are selected. <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by a category plural symbol, all the corresponding elements are selected.
				Category plural symbols are: <b>markers</b>, <b>notes</b>, <b>chords</b>, <b>rests</b>,
				<b>measures</b>, <b>breakpoints</b>, <b>tails</b>, <b>voices</b>. <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>voice</b> followed by one or more integers, the corresponding voices are selected
				(negative numbers count from the last voice). <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>measure</b> followed by one or two integers (representing an address), a certain measure is selected.
				The full syntax for the integers is: <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m>. If just one integer is given, the voice number is considered
				to be by default 1.
				For instance, <b>sel measure 3</b> selects the third measure [of first voice], while <b>sel measure 2 3</b> does the same with the second voice.
				Negative positions are also allowed, counting backwards. Multiple measures can be selected at once, provided that instead of a list integers one gives
				a sequence of wrapped lists of integers, for instance <b>sel measure [2 3] [2 4] [2 7] [5 1]</b>.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbols <b>measure range</b>, a certain measure range is selected.
				If a single argument (after the <b>measure range</b> symbols) is given, this is either a single number, representing the measure number to be selected,
				in all voices, or an llll in the form <b>[<m>start_meas_num</m> <m>end_meas_num</m>]</b>, representing the range of measures (from the one
				whose number is <m>start_meas_num</m> to the one whose number is <m>end_meas_num</m>) to be selected, in all voices.
				If a second argument is given, this is expected to be an llll containing the numbers of the voices for the selection
				(default being <b>[]</b>, meaning: all voices]. For instance <b>selmeasures [4 12] [1 2 5]</b> selects the range of measures
				from 4 to 12 only in voices 1, 2 and 5. If a single number is given instead of the voices llll, the selection is performed only
				for the voice having such number.
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>chord</b> followed by one, two or three integers (representing an address), a certain chord is selected.
				The full syntax for the integers is: <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>. If less elements are given, the first ones are considered
				to be by default 1's. The chord index is the counting index of the chord inside the measure. If the <m>measure_number</m> is replaced by the symbol <b>any</b>,
				then the <m>chord_index</m> is interpreted as global (and not measure-wise).
				For instance, <b>sel chord 2 3</b> selects the third chord of second measure [of first voice], while <b>sel chord 4 2 3</b> does the same with the fourth voice.
				Negative positions are also allowed, counting backwards. Multiple chords can be selected at once, provided that instead of a l ofist integers one gives
				a sequence of wrapped lists of integers, for instance <b>sel chord [2 3] [4 1 2] [5 6 1]</b>.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>note</b> followed by one, two, three or four integers (representing an address), a certain note is selected.
				The full syntax for the integers is: <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>. If less elements are given, the first ones are considered
				to be by default 1's. The chord index is the counting index of the chord inside the measure; the note index is taken from the lowest to the highest.
				If the <m>measure_number</m> is replaced by the symbol <b>any</b>, then the <m>chord_index</m> is interpreted as global (and not measure-wise).
				For instance, <b>sel note 4 2 3</b> selects the third note of second chord of fourth measure [of first voice], while <b>sel note 5 4 2 3</b> does the same with the fifth voice.
				Negative positions are also allowed, counting backwards. Multiple notes can be selected at once, provided that instead of a list integers one gives
				a sequence of wrapped lists of integers, for instance <b>sel note [5 2 4 3] [1 1 1 -1]</b>.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbols <b>note if</b>, <b>chord if</b>, <b>voice if</b>, <b>measure if</b>,
				<b>rest if</b>, <b>marker if</b>, <b>breakpoint if</b> or <b>tail if</b> followed by a
				condition to be verified, a conditional selection on notes,  markers or pitch breakpoints (respectively) is performed.
				and notes/markers/pitch breakpoints matching such condition are selected.
				The condition must be an expr-like expression returning 1 if notes have to be selected, 0 otherwise.
				You can use symbolic variables inside such expressions. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance <b>sel note if velocity == 100</b> selects all notes whose
				velocity is exactly equal to 100, while <b>round[cents / 100.] % 12 == 0</b> select all the C's.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by any other symbol or sequence of symbols, these are interpreted as names, and the notation items
				matching all these names (or a single name, if just one symbol is entered) are selected. <br />

				Send a command to selected items

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>sendcommand <m>&lt;int: command_number&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Example: <b>sendcommand 3</b>   <i>→ send 3rd command</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>sendcommand</m> message sends a given command to the selected notation items,
				whose content is then immediately output from the playout in playout syntax (see <m>dumpselection</m>)
				but with a router different from the standard playout syntax router, i.e. the router defined by the given command.
				It expects as argument the number of the command to be sent (1 to 5).
				You can safely rely on the fact that elements will be output ordered by onset.
				Commands are a mechanism to output selected content with given labels.
				You can define up to 5 user commands which will send user-defined messages upon a note or chord evaluation.
				The idea is that you can map each command to a hotkey: if one triggers the hot key (when something is selected),
				this will cause the output of the notes/chord content from the playouts, exactly as if such notes/chords were played.
				The only difference with the simple play situation, is that the router of those messages is not the "note" or "chord" symbol,
				but rather the custom symbol defined at the command declaration. This allows you to properly detect and route the message.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

			<digest>
				Move the playhead cursor
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>setcursor <m>&lt;llll: position&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>setcursor 2000</b>   <i>→ set the playhead at 2s</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor [4]</b>   <i>→ set the playhead at beginning of measure 4</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor [4.5]</b>   <i>→ set the playhead at half of measure 4</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor [4 1/4]</b>   <i>→ set the playhead after 1/4 of measure 4</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor [2 4 1/4]</b>   <i>→ set the playhead after 1/4 of measure 4, in second voice</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor John</b>   <i>→ set the cursor at the onset of the first item named 'John'</i><br />
				• <b>setcursor John Lennon</b>   <i>→ set the cursor at the onset of the first item named 'John' and 'Lennon'</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>setcursor</m> message moves the playhead cursor to a specific position, given as argument in milliseconds (if a single number is entered)
				or as a timepoint (if an llll is entered). <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>setcursor</m> message can also directly move the playhead cursor to the position where a marker is. In this case, the syntax is
				<b>setcursor <m>MARKER_NAME_OR_NAMES</m></b>, where <m>MARKER_NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is a single name or plain list of names.
				The playhead cursor is moved to the first marker matching all the names (if any).

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>setmeasureparameters <m>&lt;llll: measure&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>setmeasureparameters 3 [width 400] [barline d]</b>   <i>→ set measure 3 to have width 400 pixel and dashed barline</i><br />
				• <b>setmeasureparameters [2 3] [width 400] [barline d]</b>   <i>→ the same, only for measure 3 of voice 2</i><br />
				• <b>setmeasureparameters 5 [shownumber -2] [barline h]</b>   <i>→ set measure 5 to have show measure number -2 and have hidden barline</i><br />
				• <b>setmeasureparameters 2 [shownumber off]</b>   <i>→ set measure 2 not to show any number</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>setmeasureparameters</m> will set specified measure parameters for a given measure.
				The measure number is given as first argument: if it is a single integer, measure parameters are applied to all measure (throughout all voices)
				having such measure number; if it is a wrapped list in the form <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m>]</b>, measure parameters are only applied
				to the measure identified by the <m>measure_number</m> and for the voice identified by the <m>voice_number</m>.
				Any further argument is an <m>SPECIFICATION</m> llll, specifying the measure parameter to be changed, yielding a complete syntax of
				<b>setmeasureparameters <m>MEASURE</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...</b>. <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				<br />
				A <m>setslot</m> message (or <m>addslot</m> for backward compatibility)
				will replace the content of one or more slots, for all the selected notes.
				The syntax is <b>setslot [<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>] [<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]...</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.

				• <b>subscore [] [3 7]</b>   <i>→ extract all voices, from measure 3 to measure 7</i><br />
				• <b>subscore [1 2] []</b>   <i>→ extract voices 1 and 2 for the whole duration</i><br />

				• <b>subroll [1 3] [4 -1] [clefs markers body]</b>   <i>→ only dump clefs, markers and body</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>subscore</m> message outputs the gathered syntax information of a portion of the <o>bach.score</o>,
				namely it outputs only certain voices and within a certain time interval.
				The syntax for the <m>subscore</m> message is:
				<b>subscore <m>VOICES</m> <m>MEASURE_RANGE</m> <m>optional:SELECTIVE_OPTIONS</m></b>,
				<m>VOICES</m> is an llll of the kind <b>[<m>voice_number1</m> <m>voice_number2</m>...]</b>
				containing the number of the voices to be output; leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to output all voices. <br />
				<m>MEASURE_RANGE</m> is an llll of the kind <b>[<m>start_measure_number</m> <m>end_measure_number</m>]</b> representing the
				range of measures that has to be output (the defined one are included).
				Leave such list as <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want this range to be all the measures of the <o>bach.score</o>.
				Otherwise <m>start_measure_number</m> is the number of the starting measure in the range, and
				<m>end_measure_number</m> is the number of the ending measure in the range; leave any negative value
				for <m>end_ms</m> if you want the portion of <o>bach.score</o> to be output to go till the end of the notation object. <br />
				The third llll, <m>optional:SELECTIVE_OPTIONS</m>, is optional, and if given might contain a symbol or list of symbols
				which handles what part of the header should be dumped. By default all header is output. Options for these symbols are exactly
				the same as for the <m>dump</m> message (see its documentation to know more). For instance <b>subscore [4 5] [4 9] [clefs markers body]</b>
				output voices 4 and 5 in the portion of the <o>bach.score</o> going from measure 4 to measure 9, and outputs in addition to the musical content (the body)
				the information about clefs and the markers.
				Leave <b>[body]</b> as third parameter if you only want to dump the music content, and no header information

				Syntax: <b>symduration <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: symduration&gt;</m> <i>[message attributes]</i> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>symduration 1/4</b>   <i>→ change duration of selected items to 1/4</i><br />
				• <b>symduration = 1/4</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>symduration = symduration * 2</b>   <i>→ double the duration</i><br />

				• <b>symduration = [velocity/16] * 8</b>   <i>→ assign durations depending on velocity</i><br />
				<br />
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@adaptts</m> (int, default: 0): Also adapt time signature (1 = if it needs to increase, 2 = if it needs to decrease, 3 = both)<br />
				<m>@adapttsscope</m> (int, default: 1): Scope for <m>adaptts</m> (0 = this measure only, 1 = all synchronous measures)<br />
				<m>@autorhythm</m> (int, default: 1): Also retranscribe rhythm<br />
				<m>@autobeam</m> (int, default: 1): Also rebeam measure<br />
				<m>@autocomplete</m> (int, default: 1): Also autocomplete measure if needed<br />
				<br />
				The word <m>symduration</m>, followed by a rational number, sets the new duration, in symbolic units, for all
				the selected notation items. <br /> <br />
				The number can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing duration, or by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Test hypotetical domain
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>testdomain <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;llll: domain_start&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>testdomain 200</b>   <i>→ send domain information if the domain started at 200ms</i><br />
				• <b>testdomain [2]</b>   <i>→ the same, if it started at measure 2</i><br />
				• <b>testdomain [1 1/8]</b>   <i>→ the same, if it started at measure 1, after 1/8</i><br />
				• <b>testdomain [2 1 1/8]</b>   <i>→ the same, if it started at measure 1, after 1/8, in voice 2</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>testdomain</m> message forces <o>bach.score</o> to output from the playout a hypotetical domain,
				given a fixed domain starting point. The idea is that the user asks <o>bach.score</o> which would be the complete domain if such domain
				started at a given point.
				The hypotetical starting point of the domain is given as argument, and can be expressed either as absolute millisecond position (a single floating point
				number) or as a timepoint (an llll).
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				The syntax of the output answer is: <b>testdomain <m>start_ms</m> <m>end_ms</m> <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where the
				two elements following the "testdomain" symbol are the starting and ending point of the hypotetical domain in milliseconds,
				and each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll containing the information about the timepoints of each voice (i.e. at which measure and point in measure,
				for each voice, the domain would start and end]: its syntax is: <b>[[<m>start_measure_number</m> <m>start_sym_onset</m>]
				[<m>end_measure_number</m> <m>end_sym_onset</m>] <m>total_sym_duration</m>]</b>, where <m>start_measure_number</m> is the measure number of the
				measure where the domain would start, and <m>start_sym_onset</m> is the symbolic onset (point inside the measure) at which the domain start would happen;
				<m>end_measure_number</m> is the measure number of the
				measure where the domain would end, and <m>end_sym_onset</m> is the symbolic onset (point inside the measure) at which the domain end would happen;
				finally <m>total_sym_duration</m> is the global duration the domain would have, in symbolic units. <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>tie <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: tie&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>tie 0</b>   <i>→ remove all ties for selection</i><br />
				• <b>tie = 0</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>tie = 1</b>   <i>→ selected notes will start ties (if possible)</i><br />
				• <b>tie = 2</b>   <i>→ selected notes will end ties (if possible)</i><br />
				• <b>tie = 3</b>   <i>→ selected notes will both start and end ties (if possible)</i><br />
				• <b>tie = 3 - tie</b>   <i>→ flip ties for selection</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>tie</m>, followed by an integer, sets the new tie status for all the selected notation items.
				Such integer should be 0 for "no tie", 1 for "tie starts", 2 for "tie ends", 3 for "tie stards and ends".
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded.
				Any of the numbers can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing velocity.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding

				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and

				<br />
				The <m>timepoint</m> message, either followed by a single number, considered as milliseconds position,
				or by an llll representing the timepoint syntax, will convert the inserted time position into milliseconds and timepoint for
				all voices of the current score (different voices might end up having different timepoints only if tempi or timesignatures are not synchronous).
				The output answer is sent through the playout, and its syntax is: <b>timepoint <m>ms</m> <m>TP_voice1</m> <m>TP_voice2</m>...</b>, where the
				<m>TP_voice</m> are lllls in timepoint syntax. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.

				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

				<br />
				A <m>velocities2dynamics</m> message will infer and assign chord dynamics and hairpins, depending on the current velocities,
				for the whole score or - if "selection" is set as first argument, for the selected items only.
				The dynamics sequence considered is the one contained in the slot
				linked to dynamics, if any (see <m>linkdynamicstoslot</m>), or in another slot, if given as integer argument. <br />
				Unless explicit dynamic-velocity mapping is defined, a default mapping is used. Two message attributes handle such default mapping: <br />
				• the "maxchars" attribute sets the width of the dynamics spectrum; <br />
				• the "exp" attribute sets the exponent for the conversion. <br />
				The dynamics spectrum is the sequence of standard dynamics in the piano-to-forte range.
				It is characterized by its "maxchars", i.e. the maximum number of p's and f's of the elements it contains ("mp" and "mf"
				are considered as having 0 p's and f's).
				For instance, the collection of
				{"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"} makes for a spectrum of <m>maxchars</m> = 2.
				The "maxchars" property of the dynamic spectrum will factor into different conversions between dynamics and velocities,
				in combination with a conversion exponent.
				The dynamic range is set via the "maxchars" parameter, while the exponent is set via the "exp" parameter (greater than 0. and less or equal to 1.).
				If "exp" is 1., the velocity range is divided linearly between the dynamics in the spectrum; otherwise an exponential scaling is applied.
				Default exponent is 0.8, and default range width is 5 (from "pppp" to "ffff").
				Any dynamic marking outside the spectrum will be clipped to the spectrum during conversion.
				The dynamics are scaled so that "mp" will always correspond to velocity = 64.
				If i is the index of the
				If <m>i</m> is the 1-based index of the element of a spectrum containing 2D elements <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(-1+2i/(2D+1))*|-1+2i/(2D+1)|^a)/2)^b <br />
				More clearly, once set x = x(i, D) = -1+2i/(2D+1), between -1 and 1, one has <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(x)*|x|^a)/2)^b. <br />
				This function assumes values between 0. and 1., for x in [-1, 1].
				In any case vel(i) is clipped to 127 (128 won't be allowed).
				The parameter <m>a</m> is the "exp" parameter defined above. The parameter <m>b</m> is chosen so that vel("mp") = vel(D) = 64, which yields <br />
				b = 1/(1 - log2(1 - 1/((2D+1)^a))) <br />
				As an example, if "exp" (i.e. <m>a</m>) is 0.8 (hence <m>b</m> is about 0.745),
				consider the spectrum {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 2 and <m>D</m> = 3 (containing <m>2D</m> = 6 elements).
				The dynamics "f" has index 5, hence x = x(5, 3) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 10/7 = 3/7, hence <br />
				vel("f") = vel(5) = 128 * ((1 + (3/7)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.810 ~ 103, <br />
				while within the broader spectrum {"pppp", "ppp", "pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff", "fff", "ffff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 4 and <m>D</m> = 5,
				one has x = x(7, 5) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 14/11 = 3/11
				vel("f") = vel(7) = 128 * ((1 + (3/11)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.748 ~ 96. <br />
				Moreover, the "mapping" attribute defines a non-standard or more general mapping via an llll specification. Such parameter has syntax
				<b>[mapping [<m>dynamics1</m> <m>velocity1</m>] [<m>dynamics2</m> <m>velocity2</m>]...]</b>.
				Differently from <m>dynamics2velocities</m>, if you define a mapping, you need to define the velocity association for each of the dynamic marking
				you want to use. <br />
				An "unnecessary" attribute toggles whether unnecessary dynamic markings should
				by default be dropped (default is 1: yes, use 0 to turn this of). <br />
				A "thresh" attribute sets a threshold for hairpin detection (default is 1., 0. meaning: no hairpin detection). <br />
				Two attributes, "mindyn" and "maxdyn", allow setting special symbols to be assigned to velocities below 1 and above 127 respectively
				(both numbers included).
				If "none" is provided (default), there will be no special symbol for these cases.

			<digest>
				Modify the velocity of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>velocity <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: velocity&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>velocity 120</b>   <i>→ set selected items' velocity to 120</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = 120</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = velocity * 1.2</b>   <i>→ increase velocity</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = symduration*127</b>   <i>→ assign velocity depending on symbolic duration</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = "random[40, 121]"</b>   <i>→ assign velocity randomly</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>velocity</m>, followed by a number, sets the new velocity (from 1 to 127) for all
				the selected notation items.
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded.
				Any of the numbers can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing velocity.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents),
				<m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch), <m>poc</m> (pitch or cents, depending on what was defined by the user),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number),
				<m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				You can also use the variables <m>numnotes</m>, <m>numchords</m> and <m>nummeasures</m> to determine the number of notes/chords/measures
				that a otation item has (e.g. the number of chords in a measure, or the number of notes in a chord). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Sets the way of displaying accidentals: <br />

				- Classical: accidentals are displayed with the classical symbols (sharps, flats...).
				This option is only available if <m>tonedivision</m> is 2, 4 or 8. <br />
				- Fraction: accidentals are displayed as fractions of tone (e.g. "-1/4" for quartertone flat or "+1/2" for
				an ordinary sharp). <br />
				- Unreduced Fraction: as the previous one, but fractions are never reduced. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is
				48 one would have "+2/8" and not "+1/4". Denominator of each fraction is the <m>tonedivision</m>
				(thus a tonedivision 2 has denominators 2, as expected for standard sharps and flats). <br />
				- Cents: accidentals are displayed as cents differences with respect to the diatonic note.
				Remark that, unless <m>tonedivision</m> is 100, the displayed cents difference will not in general correspond to the
				real cents difference: the first one will be indeed a cents difference snapped to the chosen microtonal grid.
				For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 8, a note having midicents 6027 will be displayed as a middle C with a "+25cents" accidental.

				The full November font covers a wide range of music symbols, from Renaissance to the XXI century, and gives a unique,
				warm and lively look to your music scores. It is fully compatible with Finale, Sibelius and other notation softwares.
				You can purchase November from this web address: www.klemm-music.de/notation/november/.
				Other supported fonts are: Boulez, Maestro, Petrucci, Engraver Font Set. Not all articulations are supported by all fonts.
				You can however always define custom articulations with any font of your choice.

				Clefs
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the clefs. A list of symbols is expected, the length of the list will also automatically change the <m>numvoices</m> attribute
				and update the number of voices.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				A special message <b>clefs auto</b> will detect automatically the most appropriate clefs to display
				the musical content, and will set them: such message will apply to all the existing voices, and will not change the number of voices.
				You can use the "auto" symbol instead of any symbol in order to have bach detect automatically the most appropriate clefs
				for the given voice, depending on its notes (e.g. <b>clefs auto G FG</b>). However, in this case the message will also change the
				<m>numvoices</m> attribute, as for the standard case. You can restrict the clef to be automatically chosen among a set of clefs by wrapping
				them between parentheses, preceded by the "auto" symbol. For instance, <b>clefs G F [auto F G] auto</b> will choose the 3rd clef only between
				F and G, while the fourth clef is chosen among a standard set of predefined clefs.

				Dynamics Output Mode
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the way in which information in slots of type dynamics is output (N.B.: this does not affect the
				behavior at input, since in this case all syntaxes are supported):
				0 = Plain: dynamics are output as a plain list. Manual positioning are obtained by
				having dynamic markings preceded by a
				floating point number (the relative positioning, between 0 and 1); breakpoint attachments are signaled with symbols bearing the
				breakpoint index preceded by '@' (e.g. "@3"). This is the most humanly readable option; <br />
				1 = Structured: syntax is an llll containing the information structured in an llll; each dynamic marking is represented by
				an llll, whose form depends on the attachment mode. If the marking attachment is "auto", then the form is
				<b>[auto <m>dynamic_marking</m> <m>hairpin_to_next</m>]</b>; if the marking attachment is "manual", then the form is
				<b>[<m>relative_position</m> <m>dynamic_marking</m> <m>hairpin_to_next</m>]</b>; if the marking attachment is "breakpoint", then
				the form is
				<b>[[breakpoint <m>breakpoint_index</m>] <m>dynamic_marking</m> <m>hairpin_to_next</m>]</b>.
				This option is useful when you prefer to handle lllls, but, differently from the following one, it only bears
				the minimum amount of information to assign the dynamics correctly (e.g.: no need for a relative position if we are attaching
				the dynamic to a breakpoint); <br />
				2 = Full (default): syntax is an llll containing, but always output all the information,
				as a sequence of dynamic markings each represented
				by an llll in the form
				<b>[[<m>attachment_mode</m> <m>breakpoint_attachment</m> <m>relative_position</m>] <m>dynamic_marking</m> <m>hairpin_to_next</m>]</b>.
				If a dynamic marking is set to be attached to a breakpoint ("breakpoint" attachment mode),
				both the breakpoint number and the relative position of the breakpoint are correctly output.
				If the attachment mode is "manual" or "auto", then <m>breakpoint_attachment</m> is meaningless (and left to 0),
				but in both cases the <m>relative_position</m> is correct.

				Custom Enharmonic Table
			</digest>
			<description>
				An enharmonic table is a string of elements defining the accidentals to be used for each step of the chromatic scale.
				A symbol for each voice (containing such string of characters) is expected. If less symbols than the number of voices
				are defined, the last one is padded.
				The number of elements in the string depends on the <m>tonedivision</m>; more precisely it is the <m>tonedivision</m> multiplied by 6.
				Standard case is <m>tonedivision</m> = 2, and thus the full 12 steps must be defined.
				Elements are sequencies of characters associated to accidentals.
				For instance "bb" is associated to a double flat, while "#+" is associated to a three quarter tones sharp.
				Such elements are to be separated by white spaces. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 12, a string like
				<b>enharmonictable "n # n b n n b n b n b x"</b> says that the C must be represented as natural, the note above will
				be a C# (and not a Db), the one above a D natural, the one above a Eb (and not a D#), and so on. Last note says that
				the B will actually be a Ax (A double diesis). <br />
				In the bach environment, accidentals can be written or output as ascii using the following symbols: <br />
				# for stanard 1/2 tone sharp <br />
				b for stanard 1/2 tone flat <br />
				x for stanard tone sharp <br />
				bb for stanard tone flat <br />
				+ for 1/4 tone sharp; <br />
				d or - for 1/4 tone flat; <br />
				#+ for 3/4 tone sharp; <br />
				db for 3/4 tone flat; <br />
				^ for 1/8 tone up; <br />
				v for 1/8 tone down. <br />
				Of course, these symbols can be combined, like in #+^ or dv.
				The 1/8 symbols are used also for smaller intervals (at output time).
				<br /> <br />

				Join Tuplets When Possible
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggles the ability to join tuplets automatically when possible.
				For instance, it will to gather two adjacent triplets into a single 6-plet.
				This is handy in most situations; for instance if we had a rhythm whose duration tree looked like
				<b>[[1/24 1/24 1/24] [1/24 1/24 1/24]]</b>, the algorithm would join the two triplets of sixteenth notes into
				a single sextuplet <b>[1/24 1/24 1/24 1/24 1/24 1/24]</b>.
				Such joining is performed by taking care of delimiting beat levels (e.g. in a 4/4 time signature, eighth triplets are never
				joined into 6-plets).

			<description>
				Sets the key signatures. A list of symbols is expected, one symbol for each voice.
				If less symbols are entered, the last one is padded.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.

				Loop Region
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the loop region. Two elements are expected: the starting and ending points of the loop region.
				Such elements can be simple numbers, thus representing absolute millisecond positions, or can be lllls, thus considered timepoints.
				You can substitute to the first element the "start" symbol to have the loop region start from the beginning (equivalent to 0).
				You can substitute to the second number the "end" symbol to have the loop region last till the end of the <o>bach.score</o>.
				You can simply set a <b>loop all</b> to loop the entire <o>bach.score</o>.
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				The official notation bach font is "November for bach", created by Robert Piéchaud (www.poeticprocessing.net) and
				automatically loaded at bach startup. "November for bach" is a light version of the famous November font.
				The full November font covers a wide range of music symbols, from Renaissance to the XXI century, and gives a unique,
				warm and lively look to your music scores. It is fully compatible with Finale, Sibelius and other notation softwares.
				You can purchase November from this web address: www.klemm-music.de/notation/november/.
				Other supported fonts are: Boulez, Maestro, Petrucci, Engraver Font Set.

				Sets the part grouping for voices, i.e. the lis.
				Voices can be assigned to the same staff via this <m>numparts</m> attribute. If multiple voices are assigned to the

				In this <m>numparts</m> attribute, each integer specifies the number of voices to be displayed on the same staff (or multistaff).
				For instance, if a score has 4 voices, assigning <m>parts</m> as <b>1 1 1 1</b>
				means that every voice ensemble (displayed staff) has a single voice - or, in other words, that every part is separate voice.
				If, on the other hand, one assigns <b>2 2</b> two staff ensembles are created: voices 1 and 2 are displayed on the same staff (or multistaff),
				and the same is true for voices 3 and 4. One might even set <b>4</b>
				to show all voices in a single staff or multistaff.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

				Constraint Pitches While Editing

			<description>
				Force edited pitches to lie in a given range, given by the specified llll.
				One sublist for each voice is expected. For any given voice, the sublist must be in one of the following forms: <br />
				- a plain llll specifies a list of allowed midicents, e.g. <b>[6000 6200 6400 6500 6700 6900 7100 7200]</b> will
				force edited notes to lie in the C major scale in middle octave; <br/>
				- a two-elements wrapped llll specifies a range of allowed midicents, e.g. <b>[[6000 7200]]</b> will do the same as above, but will also
				allow notes in principle to have any microtonal value such as 6050;<br/>
				- you can combine the two syntaxes to have the general one. For instance <b>[3600 4800 [6000 7200] 8400 9600]]</b> will
				force pitches to be in one of the specified C's or in the middle octave.<br/>
				Such list must be given for any voice. Use a <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> list to allow all possibilities for a voice.
				For instance: <b>pitchededitrange [7100] [[6000 7200]] []</b> will force first voice's edited notes to snap to 7100 mc (and no other note can be inserted or edited!),
				second voice's edited notes to lie in middle octave, and third voice's edited notes to assume any available pitch. <br />
				Note names (in latin or anglo-saxon syntax) can always be used instead of midicents.

				Playout Mode

			<description>
				Sets the syntax of the content output from the playout: either a chordwise playout syntax,
				or a notewise playout syntax (default). <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				Full Path In Playout Syntax
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggle the ability to output from the playout, instead of the voice number, the full path
				to get to the played element.
				The playout syntax normally has as first element the voice number of the output item (note or chord).
				By default this attribute is 0, and the simple voice number is output as first element. <br />
				If this flag is active, for <o>bach.roll</o>, the voice number is substituted with the list
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is chord-wise, or
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is note-wise.
				The <m>chord_index</m> is the index of the chord, when ordered by onsets. The <m>note_index</m> is the
				index of the note (from the lowest to highest one).
				For instance, instead of <b>note 1 1 [...]</b> one might have <b>note [1 4 2] 1 [...]</b>, meaning that
				the output information concerns the 2nd note of 4th chord of 1st voice.
				Voice is anyway always the first element in the output llll. <br />
				If this flag is active, for <o>bach.score</o>, the voice number is substituted with a list of lists, namely
				<b>[<m>LIST1</m> <m>LIST2</m>...]</b>. The slightly complex form is due to the fact that
				tied notes or chords are output just once for all from the playout, so that each output element
				may be a combination of subsequently tied notes or chords. Each one of the <m>LIST</m>s represents one of these elements,
				and has the form
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is chord-wise, or
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is note-wise.
				The <m>chord_index</m> is the index of the chord inside the measure. The <m>note_index</m> is the
				index of the note (from the lowest to highest one).
				For instance, instead of <b>note 1 1 [...]</b> one might have <b>note [[1 3 4 2] [1 4 1 3]] 1 [...]</b>,
				meaning that the output information concerns two notes: the 2nd note of 4th chord of 3rd measure of 1st voice,
				which is tied to the 3rd note of 1st chord of 4th measure of 1st voice.
				Voice is anyway always the first element in the output llll. <br />

				Play Partial Notes
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggle the ability to play partial notes, when the playhead starts from a point where a note has
				already started but not yet ended. In this case, all temporal information (temporal slots, pitch breakpoints)
				is properly trimmed, and the corresponding partial note is played.
				By default this is 1 (quiet playing); if you set the attribute to 2 (verbosely), instead of the onset a
				llll in the form <b>[partial <m>original_onset</m> <m>played_onset</m> <m>offset</m>]</b> is output.

				Play Rests

			<description>
				Toggles the ability to also play rests, having <b>rest</b> as symbol router for the playout llll.
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				Prevent Editing For
			</digest>
			<description>
				Prevents the interface editing of the specified elements, specified via an llll. Somehow, this is a lock specified globally for given notation items or features.
				If the first symbol is a "-" (minus), the editing is prevented for any element or feature, except for the specified ones. <br />
				The llll must contain at its root level: <br />
				- either single symbols, with the items or features names to be completely "locked", e.g. <b>preventedit measure lyrics inspector</b> will prevent the editing of all measures
				(one cannot create, delete, modify them), lyrics, and will not allow the opening of the bach inspector; <br />
				- or lllls in the form <b>[<m>item_or_feature_name</m> <m>property1</m> <m>property2</m> <m>property3</m>...]</b>, where properties are symbols which restrict the locking
				only to a given aspect of the item or feature. For instance, <b>preventedit [measure create delete] [marker onset]</b> will prevent the creation and deletion of measures
				(but not their modification!), and will also prevent the movement of existing markers (but not the creation of new ones!). <br/>
				The two approaches. <br />
				Here is the complete list of symbols which can be used to define items and feature names; parentheses list symbols for the single properties which one can block for them: <br />
				notes (create, delete, onset, duration, pitch, velocity, modify), measures (create, delete, rhythmictree, modify), voice (create, delete, name, clef, key, position, modify),
				breakpoints (create, delete, onset, pitch, velocity, modify), tempi (create, delete, modify), slots, markers (create, delete, onset, name, modify), articulations (create, delete),
				selection, zooming, dilationrectangle, groups, inspector, popup, slotinfo, lyrics, cursor, loop, scrollbar, drop. <br />
				The "modify" symbol only refers to modification different from the previously defined ones. For instance: <b>preventedit [breakpoints modify]</b> will not
				prevent the modification of breakpoints onsets, but will, as an example, prevent the modification of breakpoints slopes. Use <b>preventedit [breakpoints onset modify]</b> to do both.

				Output And Save Level Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggles the saving and output of level type information.
				If this attribute is set to 1 (default), and <m>outputtrees</m> is not set on "Never", level type information of each level is output
				within the level from the first outlet (gathered syntax). Also such information is stored inside the lllls created
				after a <m>write</m> or <m>writetxt</m> message.
				Level type information concerns the "life" of the rhythmic levels inside a given measure. Indeed, some of those levels may have been
				created by the user, some other levels may have been refined by <o>bach.score</o>, some other again may correspond to beats, and may been created to make
				the rhythmic tree compatible with the time signature (see <m>maketreecompatiblewithts</m>). All such differences are important to <o>bach.score</o>,
				in order to know how it should behave towards such levels: it'll take great care of the level you've introduced yourself, while it'll
				bother less to modify levels it had refined itself, and so on. This information is thus useful for a correct handling of the score interface. <br />
				Level type information can only be stored in gathered-syntax lllls, at the beginning of each level in an llll of the following form:
				<b>[leveltype <m>type</m>]</b>, where <m>type</m> is an integer defining the type of the level.
				Such integer is undocumented, and you should always consider level types as being opaque for the user: never set them "manually", only
				deal with them at output or while saving the content. Removing leveltype lllls yields a perfectly valid <o>bach.score</o> llll.

				If this is 1, the <m>done</m> notification is not sent when the content has been loaded or built,

				Display Accidentals
			</digest>
			<description>
				Handles the display of accidentals: <br />
				- Classically (default): for <o>bach.score</o>: accidentals are displayed classically, i.e. on the first (altered) note requiring them,
				and them never for any other note inside the same measure (but cautionary accidentals are possible: see the attribute <m>cautionaryaccidentals</m>);
				for <o>bach.roll</o>: this coincides with Altered Note (No Naturals) (see below). <br />
				- Always: accidentals are always displayed for all altered and naturals notes. <br />
				- Altered Notes: accidentals are always displayed for any altered note. Natural signs are preserved for notes which have to cancel such accidental. <br />
				- Altered Notes (No Repetition): accidentals are always displayed for any altered note, but dropped for immediate repetitions of the same note. <br />
				- Altered Note (No Naturals): accidentals are always displayed for any altered note, and natural signs are dropped for notes having to cancel such accidentals.
				In this case all non-natural notes have their accidental, and all natural notes have no accidental. <br />
				- Never: accidentals are never shown (always hidden). <br />
				IMPORTANT: be aware of the fact that, due to the cross dependencies between accidentals, in <o>bach.roll</o> the "Altered Notes"
				"Altered Notes (No Repetition)" configurations can be sensibly slower than any other any other configuration
				(<o>bach.score</o>, on the other hand, does not suffer from this issue).

			<description>
				Sets the spacing algorithm: <br />
				- Smart (default): as the "Note/Time Signature" algorithm, but where the proportionality parameter is automatically inferred, and may
				vary from measure to measure depending on the musical content. <br />
				- Note/Time Signature: strikes a balance between two algorithms: a "Note" algorithm, where spacing takes only into account the actual width of each
				chord and note (independently from its duration), and a "Time Signature" algorithm, where spacing takes only into account the symbolic onset of each
				chord inside the measure (independently from how much space is required to display it). The balance between these two algorithms is handled via the
				attribute <m>spacingproportionality</m>: when it is 0 one has the pure Note algorithm, when it is 1 one has the pure Time Signature algorithm. Any value in
				between is allowed. <br />
				- Proportional: music content is displayed as if it were in a <o>bach.roll</o>, i.e. proportionally to absolute durations (in milliseconds) and onsets.
				notation elements such as time signatures or barlines are preserved, but might superpose to notes or chords. <br />
				- Spring: display spacing using a modelization where each chords is attached to two imaginary "springs", connecting it to the next and the previous one.
				Spacing is thus the overall result of this physical model.

				Syncopation Max Dur/Pos-Ratio
			</digest>
			<description>
				Handles the display of syncopation depending on their position and their left side duration.
				It is the maximum allowed ratio between the syncopation position, with numerator forcedly set to 1, and the
				duration of the syncopation left side, in order for a syncopation to be a merged syncopation. This might
				appear complicated: if so, just leave it to the default value of 2.5. However, the idea is that this ratio
				somehow tells "how simple" the syncopation is. <br />
				A syncopation can be either tied or merged, depending, respectively, if it is represented by two tied chords, or by a single (larger) chord,
				placed across a given beat. Syncopations are characterized in <o>bach.score</o> by a precise position inside the measure, which is the symbolic onset
				(with respect to the measure) of the beat across which the syncopation happens. Once we have such position, one can see the two
				sides of the syncopation: a left and a right side, each characterized by their duration.

			<description>
				In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,
				by representing the number of steps in which each tone is divided.
				For the standard semitonal representation (where just sharps and flats suffice), one can stick with
				<m>tonedivision</m> being 2, meaning: the tone is divided into two semitones.
				By increasing this value, the microtonal grid gets more dense: for instance, 4 is the quartertonal grid
				(where each tone is divided in 4 quartertones); 8 is the eight-tonal grid, and so on.

				Sets the way in which rhythmic trees are interpreted. Some options are available, from the less invasive to the most invasive: <br />

				- Refine Only Graphically: see "Refine", but the refined levels are only displayed graphically and never output upon <m>dump</m>. <br />
				- Refine: tree levels can be refined internally. This option tells bach.score that the tree the user inserts may not be the actual tree,
				but a precise suggestion, and score is allowed to create additional beaming or tuplet levels inside the already existing levels, without
				destroying or incorporating existing levels into new ones. <br />
				- Process (default): tree levels can be refined internally and in some occasion wrapped or merged. This option tells bach.score that the tree
				the user inserts may not be the actual tree, but rather a quite loose suggestion: the algorithm is allowed to add levels if needed
				(even if they wrap existing levels), and in some particular cases to merge levels as well. <br />
				- Ignore: all tree levels are ignored: the tree the user has inserted is completely by the algorithm, which is in charge to rebuild
				it automatically, from scratch.

				Measureinfo in separate syntax..
				See the <m>llll</m> method for more information.
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.

				Measureinfo.
				The measureinfo in separate syntax
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.score</o>, Measureinfo are assigned measurewise (they are a propriety of measures): an llll for each voice, containing a specification
				for each measure is expected.  <br />
				Durations are assigned chordwise (they are symbolic durations: a propriety of chords, rather than notes):
				the separate syntax for durations will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each measure,
				possibly containing an llll for each rhythmic level (see below), containing a rational value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[[1/4 1/4 [[1/8 1/16] [1/32 1/32]] -1/4] [1/12 1/12 1/12 -3/4]] [[-1] [1/4 -3/4]]</b>.
				The symbol "t" is also accepted in input to tie a duration to the following one, e.g. <b>[[1/4 t 1/16 -3/16 -2/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, and if the <m>outputtiesindurationtree</m> is set to 1,
				such "t" symbols are also always output in the durations separate syntax.
				Grace chords are defined either by setting a rational duration of 0 (converted into 1/8 grace chords) or by setting
				a rhythmic level starting with a "g" symbol, which will thus contain all grace elements, e.g. <b>[[1/4 [g 1/8 1/16 1/16] 1/4 1/4 0 1/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, grace chords are output, in the durations gathered syntax,
				with the grace levels syntax, otherwise they are output as chords with 0 duration. <br />
				Cents, velocities, ties and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.score</o> (they propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice

				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />

				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider

				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we

				possibly containing an llll for each rhythmic level (see below), containing a rational value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[[1/4 1/4 [[1/8 1/16] [1/32 1/32]] -1/4] [1/12 1/12 1/12 -3/4]] [[-1] [1/4 -3/4]]</b>.
				The symbol "t" is also accepted in input to tie a duration to the following one, e.g. <b>[[1/4 t 1/16 -3/16 -2/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, and if the <m>outputtiesindurationtree</m> is set to 1,
				such "t" symbols are also always output in the durations separate syntax.
				Grace chords are defined either by setting a rational duration of 0 (converted into 1/8 grace chords) or by setting
				a rhythmic level starting with a "g" symbol, which will thus contain all grace elements, e.g. <b>[[1/4 [g 1/8 1/16 1/16] 1/4 1/4 0 1/4]]</b>.
				If the <m>outputtrees</m> algorithm is set to output trees from the durations outlet, grace chords are output, in the durations gathered syntax,
				with the grace levels syntax, otherwise they are output as chords with 0 duration. <br />
				Cents, velocities, ties and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.score</o> (they propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[[5500] [5400]]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.scire</o> can properly understand
				<b>[[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]]] [[5500 5400]]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut. <br /> <br />

				The ties (1 for notes starting a tie, 0 for any other note) in separate syntax
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />

				Extras.
				The extras in separate syntax.
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Playout.
				Outlet sending information about elements being played, as well as query answers and notifications.
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note.
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord. <br />
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> (<m>symbolic_duration</m> <m>duration_ms</m> <m>symbolic_onset_in_measure</m>
				<m>onset_from_score_beginning_in_ms</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>note_flag</m>) </b> <br />
				where <m>NOTE</m> is the note gathered syntax. <br />
				If <m>playrest</m> is set to 1, and the chord is a rest, the router symbol is <b>rest</b> instead of chord, and there is no <m>NOTE</m> llll. <br />
				In case the played note or chord is just a grace chord, the <m>symbolic_duration</m> becomes an llll in the form <b>[g <m>grace_symbolic_duration</m>]</b>.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>ONSET</m> none</b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped llll containing the names.
				The last <b>none</b> symbol is the marker role, currently unsupported in <o>bach.score</o>. The <m>ONSET</m> can either be a single
				floating point value, representing the onset in milliseconds (if the marker is attached to the milliseconds position), or an llll representing
				the onset timepoint (if the marker is attached to the position inside the measure). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns tempi: they are output in the form <b>tempo <m>voice_number</m> <m>tempo</m> <m>TEMPO_LLLL</m></b>,
				where <m>tempo</m> is the floating point tempo referred to the quarter note, and
				<m>TEMPO_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b>.
				If the tempo starts an accelerando/rallentando (i.e. interpolation is set to 1), then the <m>tempo</m> element is substituted by the llll
				<b>[<m>tempo</m> <m>next_tempo</m> <m>interp_duration_ms</m>]</b>.  <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns measures: if <m>playmeasures</m> is 1, at the beginning of each measure (for each voice), an llll is output
				in the form <b>measure <m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>MEASUREINFO_LLLL</m></b>.
				If a tempo and/or a chord lie at the beginning of a measure, the order of output for the elements is: measure, tempo, chord (or notes). <br />
				For all the previously exposed cases, if the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute is set to 1, the <m>voice_number</m> is substituted by
				an llll determining the address of the element (see the <m>playoutfullpath</m> attribute for more information. <br /> <br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.score</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>tie?</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, the <m>tie?</m> value is 1 only if the note starts a tie and 0 otherwise, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining one of the possible extras:
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names, articulations.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>tie?</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, unimportant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7000. 127 1 [graphic 6900 1/2] [slots [1 [0. 112.5 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [articulation stacc] [name foo] 0]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				<br /> <br />
				Measureinfo is the information about time signature and tempo, plus some other optional specifications concerning the measure itself.
				This can be a single <b><m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO</m></b> valid for all voices and all measures, or a llll containing for each measure and each voice
				an llll in the form <b>[<m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				All elements except for the <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> are optional. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> is an llll containing the measure time signature, in one of the following forms: <br />
				- <b>[<m>numerator</m> <m>denominator</m>]</b> for standard time signatures. For instance, <b>[4 4]</b> corresponds to a 4/4 time signature. <br />
				- <b>[[<m>numerator1</m> <m>numerator2</m> <m>numerator3</m>...] <m>denominator</m>]</b> for time
				signatures where the numerator is a sum of numbers.For instance <b>[[3 2 3] 8]</b>
				corresponds to a (3+2+3)/8 time signature. <br /> <br />
				The <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> represent in its simplest form, a single tempo. <br />
				A tempo, defined for a measure of a <o>bach.score</o> has one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign a quarter tempo at the beginning of the measure. For instance <b>[60]</b> will set a 1/4 = 60 tempo. <br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit (at the beginning of the measure).
				The <m>tempo_figure</m> is indeed the tempo symbolic unit: for instance <b>[3/8 40]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>]</b> will assign the tempo value to the specified symbolic unit and will put the
				tempo at the point inside the measure specified by the <m>tempo_sym_onset</m>. For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4]</b> will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40
				but not at the beginning of the measure, rather after 1/4 from the beginning.<br />
				- <b>[<m>tempo_figure</m> <m>tempo_value</m> <m>tempo_sym_onset</m> <m>interpolation_to_next?</m>]</b> will do exactly as the previous case
				but if <m>interpolation_to_next?</m> is non-zero it will also toggle the interpolation from this tempo to the following one,
				yielding an accelerando or rallentando (depending if the next tempo is faster or slower). For instance <b>[3/8 40 1/4 1]</b>
				will set a tempo of a dotted quarter = 40, after 1/4 from the beginning, and will toggle the tempo interpolation to next tempo.<br />
				If more than one tempo need to be assigned to a given measure, one needs to use the general syntax for <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m>, which is
				<b>[<m>TEMPO1</m> <m>TEMPO2</m> <m>TEMPO3</m>...]</b>, where each tempo must be in one the forms explained above. As an example, consider
				<b>[[60] [1/4 70 1/16] [1/8 60 1/8 1] [1/8 80 3/8]]</b>, where four tempi have been defined. The order of tempi is irrelevant,
				only their onset is accounted for. <br />
				Also, one might add an integer number at the beginning of each measure llll to indicate that the given measureinfo reference is valid for a
				certain number of measures, such as <b>[<m>how_many_measures</m> <m>TIME_SIGNATURE</m> <m>TEMPO_OR_LIST_OF_TEMPI</m> <m>SPECIFICATION1</m> <m>SPECIFICATION2</m>...]</b>.
				For instance <b>[5 [4 4] [[80] [1/4 160 1/2]]]</b> creates 5 measures of 4/4, each one starting with quarter = 80, and then each one accelerating
				until 1/4 = 160 exactly at half of the measure. For instance
				<b> [[[4 4] [1/8 60]] [[2 4] [1/4 50 1/4 1]] [4 [4 4]] [nil [180]]]</b> means that we start a bar 1 in 4/4 and octave note = 60, then we
				pass at 2/4 and quarter = 50 after 1/4 of measure 2, and at that moment, an accelerando starts. The accelerando lasts during 4 4/4-measures,
				and then ends at the following measure on a new tempo of quarter = 180. <br /> <br />
				Each <m>SPECIFICATION</m> is an optional llll representing a given measure parameter, in the form <b>[<m>parameter_name</m> <m>parameter_value</m>]</b>.
				The <m>parameter_name</m> is a symbol identifying the parameter. The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding
				values is the following one: <br />
				- <b>width</b>: assigns a fixed width to a measure. It expects as value a fixed width in pixels that the measure will have (referred to the default
				vertical and horizontal zoom of 100%, and modified accordingly to those). Assigning a <m>width</m> parameter will also lock the measure barline,
				so that the width will remain the same, no matter how many chords and notes the measure does and will contain. Use the "auto" symbol
				instead of the fixed width to revert to the automatic measure width assignment (depending on the measure content). <br />
				- <b>widthfactor</b>: assigns a local factor for the spacing. It expects as value a multiplier factor, which will be applied to the whole measure
				spacing, and which will compress (for values less than 1) or expand (for values
				greater than 1) the width of the measure and the spacing of its chords accordingly. In this case, the measure barline is not locked, only the
				width factor is changed. <br />
				- <b>barline</b>: assigns a specific ending barline to a given measure. It expects a specific letter, representing the barline type. This letter
				can be one of the following ones: 'a' = automatic barline (defaul), 'n' = normal barline, 'd' = dashed barline, 'p' = dotted barline (p = "points"),
				't' = double barline (t = "two"), 's' = solid barline, 'f' = final barline, 'h' = hidden barline, 'k' = tick,
				'i' = intervoice barline only (barline is only between voice staves, not over staves). <br />.
				- <b>shownumber</b>: deals with measure numbers. If an "off" symbol is given as value, it means that the measure number of the current measure will
				not be displayed. If a specific number is given, it will be assigned as a forced measure number to be displayed, for instance <b>[shownumber -4]</b> will
				show -4 as measure number (also see the attribute <m>measurenumberoffset</m>). If an "auto" symbol is given, it will show the measure's automatically
				assigned measure number (default). <br />
				- <b>boxes</b>: assign custom beaming boxes. It expects custom beaming boxes for the measure, as a plain list of rational numbers.
				Custom boxing allows you to handle beam grouping inside the measure differently than beat-wise.
				Each number of the expected list is the symbolic width of each beaming box inside the measure.
				If the given boxes don't fill the whole measure, the last one is padded. For instance, in a 4/4 measure,
				<b>[boxes 1/8]</b> will simply use eight 1/8-wide boxes to beam elements inside the measure, instead of the default 1/4 wide ones (beats).
				This is equivalent to <b>[boxes 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8 1/8]</b>.
				Analogously, <b>[boxes 1/2 1/8 1/4 1/8]</b> is a more exotic boxing for the same time signature. <br />
				As a final example, (((4 4) (60) (widthfactor 0.5) (barline h) (shownumber off))) for a given measure sets a 4/4 time signature, a quarter = 60 tempo,
				compresses the measure by a factor of two, hides its final barline and its number.
