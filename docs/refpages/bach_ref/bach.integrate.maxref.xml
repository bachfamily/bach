				It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,

				A lambda outlet is an outlet outputting an element on which some test or modification must be performed.

				In this case, domain X values are output one by one, and expect to be mapped to the corresponding Y values,

				Mode
			</digest>
			<description>
				If there is no argument or if the argument is the <b>auto</b> symbol,
				the operation mode is the automatic mode: the object has just one inlet and one outlet,
				and expects as input an incoming breakpoint function, which will be integrated.
				If the argument is the <b>lambda</b> symbol, the object is instantiated in lambda mode:
				the function is now defined via a lambda loop: X values are output through the lambda
				outlet and expect to be mapped on the desired Y values, to be plugged in the lambda inlet.

				Integrate breakpoint function or lambda-defined function
			</digest>
			<description>
				In auto mode (see arguments), an <m>llll</m> in the first inlet is considered to be a breakpoint function
				defined as a sequence of points in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>. Such function
				is integrated exactly if the function is piecewise linear, i.e. all slopes are negligible; otherwise
				the integration is performed via a sampling process (the original function is sampled in a certain number
				of points, defined by the <m>numsamples</m> attribute).
				The resulting integral function is output in the same breakpoint function form from the left outlet
				(all slopes will be 0: output function is always piecewise linear). <br />
				In lambda mode (see arguments), an <m>llll</m> in the first inlet must be either in the form
				<b>[<m>domain_start</m> <m>domain_end</m>] <m>num_sampling_points</m></b>, or must be a plain list of
				explicit sampling points (points in which integral function should be sampled). The domain points are output one by one
				from the lamdba outlet, and values of the function to integrate are collected in the lambda inlet.
				After the integration, the resulting integral function is output in the breakpoint function form
				explained above from the left outlet. <br />
				An <m>llll</m> in the second inlet is converted into a <m>float</m>.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
