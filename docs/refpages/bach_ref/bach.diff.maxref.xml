			<description>
				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
				In this case, the answer is in a 0/1 form: if the two elements
				output via the lambda outlet are equal (according to your custom meaning of the word "equality"),
				this inlet should receive a 1; otherwise it should receive a 0. <br />
				The lambda inlet also accepts the 0/1 result in a native llll form, so you can sometimes avoid the explicit @out t. <br />
				It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
				<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.

			<description>
				The <m>lambda</m> attribute allows setting a snipped of bell code

				the lambda loop will not be evaluated, and the provided code will be executed as well.
				For each lambda outlet of the object, an input pseudovariable is passed to the lambda loop,
				with their indices counted from left to right.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
