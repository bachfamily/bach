				Mode

			<description>
				If there is no argument or if the argument is the <b>auto</b> symbol,
				the operation mode is the automatic mode: the object has just one inlet and one outlet,
				and expects as input an incoming breakpoint function, which will be derived.
				If the argument is the <b>lambda</b> symbol, the object is instantiated in lambda mode:
				the function is now defined via a lambda loop: X values are output through the lambda
				outlet and expect to be mapped on the desired Y values, to be plugged in the lambda inlet.

				Derive breakpoint function or lambda-defined function

			<description>
				In auto mode (see arguments), an <m>llll</m> in the first inlet is considered to be a breakpoint function
				defined as a sequence of points in the form <b>(<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>)</b>. Such function
				is derived exactly if the function is piecewise linear, i.e. all slopes are negligible; otherwise
				the derivation is performed via a sampling process (the original function is sampled in a certain number
				of points, defined by the <m>numsamples</m> attribute).
				The resulting derivative is output in the same breakpoint function form from the left outlet
				(all slopes will be 0: output function is always piecewise linear). <br />
				In lambda mode (see arguments), an <m>llll</m> in the first inlet must be either in the form
				<b>(<m>domain_start</m> <m>domain_end</m>) <m>num_sampling_points</m></b>, or must be a plain list of
				explicit sampling points (points in which derivative function should be sampled). The domain points are output one by one
				from the lamdba outlet, and values of the function to derive are collected in the lambda inlet.
				After deriving, the resulting derivative function is output in the breakpoint function form
				explained above from the left outlet. <br />
				An <m>llll</m> in the second inlet is converted into a <m>float</m>.

				Output Discrete Derivative
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggles the ability to choose between discrete derivative and continuous derivative.
				If this attribute is active, for each couple of incoming points a derivative point is computed
				and placed at the mean point of their X coordinates. However, if this attribute is set to 0 (default), for each incoming segment
				two values are output: one at the beginning of the segment, and one at the end of the segment, with the same Y coordinate,
				retaining the original X coordinates of the segment. As a result, a piecewise linear function is mapped to a
				piecewise constant function. The number of points, thus, in this case essentially doubles the original number (up to
				a final sieving of useless function points).

			<description>
				If <m>discrete</m> is set to 1, the output discrete derivative is output.
				Such derivative, by construction, has one point less than the original number of data. This <m>pad</m> attribute handles the
				possible padding behavior: <br />
				- No Pad: output number of points will be the original number of points minus one. All output X coordinates are mean points
				of each incoming segment. <br />
				- Pad At Right (Default): output number of points will be the same as the original number of points. All output X coordinates are ending points
				of each incoming segment, and a starting point is added. <br />
				- Pad At Left: output number of points will be the same as the original number of points. All output X coordinates are starting points
				of each incoming segment, and a final point is added. <br />
				- Pad At Left And Right: output number of points will be the original number of points plus one. All output X coordinates are mean points
				of each incoming segment, and a starting and final points are added. <br />
				The padding, in all cases, is done by preserving the derivative, i.e. by constant extrapolation of the derivative.
