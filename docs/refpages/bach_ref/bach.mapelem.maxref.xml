				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
				In this case, the answer is expected to be a modification of the elements which had been sent out:
				the element output via the lambda outlet can be customly modified and then plugged in into this lambda inlet:
				such modification will be accounted for by the algorithm. <br />
				The lambda inlet also accepts the result in llll form, so you can sometimes avoid the explicit @out t. <br />
				It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
				<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.

				A lambda outlet is an outlet outputting an element on which some test or modification must be performed.
				The result of the test or modification is then expected in a lambda inlet. <br />
				In this case, the elements output from the lambda outlet may be customly modified, so that such modification will be taken into

				An llll in the first inlet will trigger the mapping via the lambda loop.

				Maximum Depth
			</digest>
			<description>
				You can use a <m>maxdepth</m> attribute in order to decide until which level of depth
				the element should be iterated and sent through the lambda outlet. The default is 0, meaning: all levels. <br />
				<m>maxdepth</m> sets the maximum depth level at which the operation must be performed.
				If negative, the depth level is counted from the innermost level of each branch of the tree.
				A value of 0 is not accepted.
				Defaults to -1, i.e. there is no limitation (stop at the innermost level).

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

				If the <m>unwrap</m> attribute is set to <m>n</m>, and is greater than 0, <m>n</m> outer levels of
				parentheses (if any) are removed from the lllls output from the lambda outlet, and are automatically re-injected
				to the lllls input from the lambda inlet. The default is 0.

	<discussion>
		Elements are iterated (as in <o>bach.iter</o>) and spit out the lambda outlet (the rightmost one).
		They are supposed to be individually modified then by patching, and the modified element is expected
		to be received in the lambda inlet. <br />
		A certain number of bach objects are equipped with "lambda" inlets and outlets. These inlets and outlets -
		always the rightmost ones - serve the purpose of letting you define a function the object will base its behavior upon.
		Such function is indeed a patching loop: parameters are taken from the lambda outlet(s), processed, and the "result" is
		plugged in the lambda inlet(s). The type of function, and the corresponding expected result, depend on the object behavior;
		for instance, cycles modifying elements will expect as "result" the modified element; cycles testing for custom equalities will
		expect a 0/1 answer (0 meaning: not equal; 1 meaning: equal), as well as cycles testing custom inequalities and sorting (1 meaning: the two
		elements are in the correct order; 0 meaning: the order is wrong). Refer to each specific object to know more about it.
		With many objects, it is not mandatory to provide an evaluation cycle: if you don't, a default function will be used. <br />
		It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
