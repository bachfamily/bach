				Output power of incoming matrix
			</digest>
			<description>
				The power of the incoming matrix is calculated and output.
				The exponent is taken from the right inlet (or from the argument). If such exponent is negative
				and the incoming matrix admits no inverse, the power cannot be computed: in this case a bang
				is sent through the right outlet. Such bang is also sent in case the incoming matrix is not
				square or not well-formed. <br />
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>(1 0 0) (0 1 0) (0 0 1)</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.

		<attribute name="out" get="1" set="1" type="symbol" size="1">
			<digest>
				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		For positive exponents, <o>bach.mpow</o> simply performs the multiplication of the
		matrix by itself a certain number of times.
		For negative exponents, it does the same with the inverse matrix: if such inverse
		cannot be computed (because the original matrix is singular), a bang
		is output through the right outlet. <br /> <br />
		In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
		For instance the matrix <b>(1 0 0) (0 1 0) (0 0 1)</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
		i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
		as the number of rows.
