				Pitch-Classes, or a 2-depth list with interleaved Velocities
			</digest>
			<description>
				A pitch-class set is a plain collection of pitch-classes. A pitch class is nothing but the representative of a set of pitches.
				Traditionally, it corresponds to the concept of "note", once we abstract it from its octave.
				For instance, the semitonal framework (when the modulo is 12), all the C belong to the same pitch-class
				which will be named 0 = {..., C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, ...}. The pitch-class 1 will be the one containing all C#'s (or Db's); pitch-class
				2 will contain all D's, and so on. One will use to name pitch class numbers from 0 to the modulo - 1: indeed, with modulo = 12, pitch-class 12 will coincide
				with pitch-class 0 (it'll be the C one octave higher). One can thus think at pitch-classes as equally spaced points on a clock, and transposing
				means rotating them on the clock. A pitch class set is thus represented just by a plain list of pitch classes, such <b>0 4 7</b>, representing the
				C major chord. Notice that this coincides with any other representation such as <b>12 4 19</b> or <b>0 -8 -5</b>, but the canonical form, where numbers
				are from 0 to the modulo-1 is always preferred. Also for pitch-class sets the order of elements is immaterial, and thus
				<b>0 4 7</b> or <b>4 0 7</b> or <b>7 4 0</b> will all represent the same set.
				On the other hand a pitch-class (as an abstract concept) can be used to represent things other than pitches,
				as for instance temporal position in a rhythmic pattern (loop) having a certain number (the modulo) of equally spaced elements.

				When a point is clicked upon, selected or de-selected, its content is output from the "Queries and Notifications" outlet,
				having as router the <b>clicked</b> symbol, and as syntax the complete point information syntax. <br /> <br />
				The complete point information syntax is the form in which point data is output
				from the query outlet. Up to a custom initial router, it has the following form:
				<b><m>cents</m> <m>pitch-class</m> <m>WRAPPED_DIATONIC_INTERVAL_FROM_CENTER</m> <m>WRAPPED_COORDINATES</m></b>,
				where <m>WRAPPED_DIATONIC_INTERVAL_FROM_CENTER</m> is in the llll diatonic intervals syntax, and <m>WRAPPED_COORDINATES</m>
				are the coordinates to get to the tonnetz point from the tonnetz center.
				<br /> <br />
				A diatonic interval is by default characterized by a couple of integer numbers (list form of diatonic intervals): the width of the interval
				in diatonic steps, and the width of the interval in chromatic steps. The number of diatonic steps in an octave
				is always 7, while the number of chromatic steps depends on the modulo; by default, in the semitonal system, it is 12.
				In such system, for instance, an ascending major third will be represented by <b>2 4</b>, since we need 2 diatonic steps
				and 4 chromatic steps to get from the bottom to the top note. As further examples, the interval between C5 and D#5 is <b>1 3</b>,
				and the interval between E#4 and Fb5 is <b>8 11</b>. <br />
				You can usually specify the diatonic interval also by directly inputting the width of the interval in midicents.
				However this is always ambiguous, and bach will chose one of the infinite diatonic ways to interpret such interval - ideally, the
				"simplest" one: 700 is a major fifth, 300 is a minor third (and not an augmented second), and so on.
				<br /> <br />
				In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
				points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.
				<br /> <br />
				The coordinate of a point of the tonnetz is the position of such point in the oblique grid created by the horizontal axis, passing
				for the tonnetz center, and the diagonal axis, at 60° counterclockwise from the horizontal one, again passing for the tonnetz center.
				Coordinates above the center and at right have positive values, below and at left have negative ones. Each point can be uniquely determined
				by the amount of steps one must take rightwards from the center (coordinate 1) and diagonlly upwards at 60° (coordinate 2) in order to
				get to the point.

				Modulo

			<description>
				Modulo of the diagram. <br />
				In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
				points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

			<description>
				Pitch-Classes, or a 2-depth list with interleaved Velocities.
				A pitch-class set is a plain collection of pitch-classes. A pitch class is nothing but the representative of a set of pitches.
				Traditionally, it corresponds to the concept of "note", once we abstract it from its octave.
				For instance, the semitonal framework (when the modulo is 12), all the C belong to the same pitch-class
				which will be named 0 = {..., C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, ...}. The pitch-class 1 will be the one containing all C#'s (or Db's); pitch-class
				2 will contain all D's, and so on. One will use to name pitch class numbers from 0 to the modulo - 1: indeed, with modulo = 12, pitch-class 12 will coincide
				with pitch-class 0 (it'll be the C one octave higher). One can thus think at pitch-classes as equally spaced points on a clock, and transposing
				means rotating them on the clock. A pitch class set is thus represented just by a plain list of pitch classes, such <b>0 4 7</b>, representing the
				C major chord. Notice that this coincides with any other representation such as <b>12 4 19</b> or <b>0 -8 -5</b>, but the canonical form, where numbers
				are from 0 to the modulo-1 is always preferred. Also for pitch-class sets the order of elements is immaterial, and thus
				<b>0 4 7</b> or <b>4 0 7</b> or <b>7 4 0</b> will all represent the same set.
				On the other hand a pitch-class (as an abstract concept) can be used to represent things other than pitches,
				as for instance temporal position in a rhythmic pattern (loop) having a certain number (the modulo) of equally spaced elements.
