		Report basic information about a pitch-class set
	</digest>

	<description>
		Reports some standard information about a pitch-class set, such as its
		cardinality, whether it is in prime form (or not), whether it is symmetrical (or not), its interval
		structure period, and its periodicity (number of different transpositions).  <br /> <br />
		In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
		points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.
		<br /> <br />
		A pitch-class set is a plain collection of pitch-classes. A pitch class is nothing but the representative of a set of pitches.
		Traditionally, it corresponds to the concept of "note", once we abstract it from its octave.
		For instance, the semitonal framework (when the modulo is 12), all the C belong to the same pitch-class
		which will be named 0 = {..., C-1, C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, ...}. The pitch-class 1 will be the one containing all C#'s (or Db's); pitch-class
		2 will contain all D's, and so on. One will use to name pitch class numbers from 0 to the modulo - 1: indeed, with modulo = 12, pitch-class 12 will coincide
		with pitch-class 0 (it'll be the C one octave higher). One can thus think at pitch-classes as equally spaced points on a clock, and transposing
		means rotating them on the clock. A pitch class set is thus represented just by a plain list of pitch classes, such <b>0 4 7</b>, representing the
		C major chord. Notice that this coincides with any other representation such as <b>12 4 19</b> or <b>0 -8 -5</b>, but the canonical form, where numbers
		are from 0 to the modulo-1 is always preferred. Also for pitch-class sets the order of elements is immaterial, and thus
		<b>0 4 7</b> or <b>4 0 7</b> or <b>7 4 0</b> will all represent the same set.
		On the other hand a pitch-class (as an abstract concept) can be used to represent things other than pitches,
		as for instance temporal position in a rhythmic pattern (loop) having a certain number (the modulo) of equally spaced elements.

				Mode

			<description>
				Criterion according to which the prime forms are chosen. <br />
				The prime form is always defined to be the "smallest" copy of a given set. This definition depends on the ordering one chooses.
				Two ordering are supported by bach: <br />
				<m>Lexicographic</m>: the prime form is the "smallest" copy of the set lexicographically (numbers are compared left to right).
				For instance <b>0 1 5 11</b> is preferred to <b>0 6 7 8</b>. <br />
				<m>Compactness First</m>: the lexicographic clause is secondary: primarily the prime form is chosen among the "most compact" prime forms,
				For instance <b>0 6 7 8</b> is preferred to its transposed <b>0 1 5 11</b>, although it is not preferred to its other transposed <b>0 1 2 6</b>.

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		The fact of being in prime form is reported both for group of transpositions and for the group of
		transpositions/inversion. <br /> <br />
		In Set Theory, two pitch-class sets are often considered to be "the same" when they are linked by the action of some simple transformation.
		For instance, the sets <b>0 1 4</b> and <b>2 3 6</b> are linked by a transposition of 2 (corresponding, on the clock diagram, to a rotation of 2 steps).
		Such "simple transformations" usually form a group. One thus usually needs to choose a group to determine a framework; this group will entail
		the concept of "copy" of a pitch-class set: which is any other pitch-class set obtained by the action of a transformation of the group.
		For instance, if our group is the group of transposition, <b>2 3 6</b> is a copy of <b>0 1 4</b>, and viceversa. <br />
		The most common groups of such form in increasing nesting are: <br />
		- the group of transposition: formed by all the transposition by a certain amount, and there are only 12 transposition if our modulo is 12, or
		in general n transposition if our modulo is n (the mathemathicians would say that such group is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_n).
		For instance, a C major chord is the same as a D major chord, with respect to this group, but it is NOT the same as a C minor chord. <br />
		- the group of transposition and inversions: formed by all the transposition of the previous group, plus all the combination of such transposition with
		inversions, i.e. reflection with respect to any axis on the clock diagram. If our modulo is n, this group has 2n elements (the mathemathicians
		would say that such group is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_n).
		For instance, a C major chord is the same as a D major chord, with respect to this group, and also the same as a C minor chord. <br />
		- the affine group of transposition, inversions, and multiplications: this group (here things get a little bit more complicated...) is formed
		by all the elements of the previous group plus we add the transformation multiplying each pitch class by a certain number k (prime with the modulo).
		Classical multiplications, with modulo = 12, are M_5 (multiplication by 5) and M_7 (multiplication by 7).
		For instance, our <b>0 4 7</b> C major chord is the same as <b>0 8 11</b>, since 5 * (0 4 7) = (0 20 35) = (0 8 11). <br />
		Up to the group of transposition and inversion, the interval vector of a pitch-class set is preserved. The affine group does not preserve the interval vector.
