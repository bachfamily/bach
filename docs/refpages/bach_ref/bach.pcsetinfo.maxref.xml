				In the standard framework, the modulo is the number of subdivision of the octave (represented as a circle). The modulo is thus the number of
				points in this circle. The default and most common modulo is 12 (corresponding to semitonal grid). Modulo 24 is the quartertone grid, and so on.

				Mode
			</digest>
			<description>
				Criterion according to which the prime forms are chosen. <br />
				The prime form is always defined to be the "smallest" copy of a given set. This definition depends on the ordering one chooses.
				Two ordering are supported by bach: <br />
				<m>Lexicographic</m>: the prime form is the "smallest" copy of the set lexicographically (numbers are compared left to right).
				For instance <b>0 1 5 11</b> is preferred to <b>0 6 7 8</b>. <br />
				<m>CompactnessÂ First</m>: the lexicographic clause is secondary: primarily the prime form is chosen among the "most compact" prime forms,
				For instance <b>0 6 7 8</b> is preferred to its transposed <b>0 1 5 11</b>, although it is not preferred to its other transposed <b>0 1 2 6</b>.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
