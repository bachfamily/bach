	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		The algorithm used to compute the matrix inverse is the Gaussian elimination algorithm.
		If the matrix is singular, the inverse does not exists, and bach.inv outputs a bang from
		its middle outlet. If the matrix is not well-shaped or not square,
		bach.inv outputs a bang from its right outlet. <br /> <br />
