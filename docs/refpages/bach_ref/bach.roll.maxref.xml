				The onsets (in milliseconds) in separate syntax.
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, onsets are the only parameter assigned chordwise (they are a propriety of chords, rather than notes).
				The separate syntax for onsets will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing a value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[0 1000 2000 3000] [100 400] [250 2500]</b>. <br />
				Cents, durations, velocities and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.roll</o> (they are propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [[5500] [5400]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.roll</o> can properly understand
				<b>[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [5500 5400]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut.

				Extras
			</digest>
			<description>
				The extras in separate syntax.
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Playout
			</digest>
			<description>
				Outlet sending information about elements being played, as well as query answers and notifications.
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				left, above or below with respect to the currently selected item.
				If no item is selected, the first two commands will move the horizontal scrollbar, if any (left or right).<br />
				• <m>Cmd+A</m> (mac) or <m>Ctrl+A</m> (win): Select all items <br />

				If the content is a slot content, assign such slot content to all selected notes. <br />
				• <m>Cmd+Shift+V</m> (mac) or <m>Ctrl+Shift+V</m> (win): Paste in-place. If the content in the clipboard are chords, paste chords at the original position
				(so that they overlap with the existing ones, unless these latter have been deleted). <br />
				• <m>Cmd+Alt+V</m> (mac) or <m>Ctrl+Shift+V</m> (win): Paste replace. If the content in the clipboard are chords, paste chords at the place of the currently selected items
				(i.e. deletes the current selection and replaces it with the clipboard content) <br />
				<br />
				For pitch breakpoints: <br />
				• <m>Esc</m>: Revert slope to 1 for selected breakpoints (the slope refers to the duration line segment preceding the breakpoints). <br />

				Syntax: <b>addbreakpoint <m>&lt;float: relative_x_position&gt;</m> <m>&lt;float: delta_midicents&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;float: slope&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: velocity&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>addbreakpoint 0.5 200</b>   <i>→ add a breakpoint at the middle of the note of +200cents</i><br />
				• <b>addbreakpoint 0.5 200 0.2</b>   <i>→ the same, with slope 0.2</i><br />
				• <b>addbreakpoint 0.5 200 0.2 80</b>   <i>→ the same, with velocity 80</i><br />
				<br />
				Adds a pitch breakpoint to each one of the selected notes.
				The breakpoint is given by three arguments: <br />
				- a float number between 0 and 1, setting the relative position of the pitch breakpoint
				with respect to the note duration line (0 being the note head, 1 being the note tail).
				0 and 1 should be avoided (since a notehead and notetail already exists for any note), so the
				values should be striclty greater than 0 and strictly less than 1. <br />
				- a number setting the pitch difference (in midicents) of the breakpoint with respect to the main
				note's pitch.
				- an optional slope parameter, between -1 and 1, setting the slope of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint
				(0 being linear, default).
				- an optional velocity parameter, between 1 and 127, but only if the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is active.

				Syntax: <b>addchord <m>[&lt;int: voice_number&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;llll: chord&gt;</m> <i>[message attributes]</i> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>addchord [1000 [6000 500 50]]</b>   <i>→ add a middle C at 1s, lasting 0.5s and with velocity 50</i><br />
				• <b>addchord 2 [1000 [6000 500 50]]</b>   <i>→ the same, in second voice</i><br />
				• <b>addchord 2 [1000 [6000 500 50]] @sel 1</b>   <i>→ the same, also selecting the chord</i><br />
				• <b>addchord 2 [1000 [6000 500 50] [7200 0.5 50]]</b>   <i>→ add a chord with two notes</i><br />
				• <b>addchord 2 [1000 [6000 500 50 [slots [3 10 20 30]]] [7200 0.5 50 [breakpoints [0 0 0] [1 -500 0]]]]</b>   <i>→ and with extra information</i><br />
				<br />
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@sel</m> (int, default: 0): Also select the added chord<br />
				<br />
				An <m>addchord</m> message will add a new chord to the existing ones.
				The first optional integer argument is the number of the voice in which the chord should be placed.
				Then, the chord must be given in its gathered syntax llll form as argument. For instance, <b>addchord 2 [1000 [6100 1000 50]]</b>
				adds a chord in the second voice having onset 1000 and a single note (pitch 6100 midicents, duration 1000 ms, velocity 50).
				If no voice number is given, first voice is used by default. <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Add several chords
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>addchords <m>[&lt;number: offset&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;llll: chords&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>addchords [[217 [7185 492 100]] [971 [6057 492 100]]] [[1665 [7157 492 100]]]</b>   <i>→ add some chords in gathered syntax</i><br />
				• <b>addchords 1500 [[217 [7185 492 100]] [971 [6057 492 100]]] [[1665 [7157 492 100]]]</b>   <i>→ same thing, shifted by 1.5 seconds</i><br />
				<br />
				An <m>addchords</m> message will add several chords to the existing ones.
				If the message has no arguments, the chords parameters are supposed to have been inserted through the separate parameter inlets,
				and the <m>addchords</m> message will essentially act like a <m>bang</m> which in turns will preserve the existing content,
				and add the newly introduced chords. Refer to the <m>llll</m> message to know more about separate parameter syntax of the inlets.<br />
				If the message has arguments, the first optional one is a number setting an offset (in millisecond) for the chords to be added.
				Further arguments are supposed to be llll form, exactly in in the same syntax as the whole <o>bach.roll</o>
				gathered syntax (without header specification): one llll for each voice,
				containing one llll for each chord to add (in chord gathered syntax, also see the <m>addchord</m> message). If for a given voice
				you don't need to add any chord, just set a <b>[]</b> llll.
				More precisely the expected syntax for the argument is <b>[<m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...]</b>
				where each voice is an llll in gathered syntax. <br /> <br />
				For instance, a valid message would be <b>addchords [[217. [7185. 492. 100]] [971. [6057. 492. 100]]] [[1665. [7157. 492. 100]]]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD1</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the

				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is

				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where

				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:

				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>addmarker <m>&lt;float/symbol: position&gt;</m> <m>&lt;llll: name_or_names&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;symbol: role&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;llll: content&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>addmarker 2000 George</b>   <i>→ add a marker named 'George' at 2s</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 2000 [Foo Fee Faa]</b>   <i>→ the same, with a complex llll name</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker cursor John</b>   <i>→ add a 'John' marker at the current playhead position</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 1000 whatever barline</b>   <i>→ add a barline marker at 1s</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 500 whatever division</b>   <i>→ add a division marker at 0.5s</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 0 whatever timesig [2 4]</b>   <i>→ add a 2/4 time signature marker at the beginning</i><br />
				• <b>addmarker 0 whatever tempo [1/4 120]</b>   <i>→ add a quarter = 120 tempo marker at the beginning</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>addmarker</m> adds a marker with a specified name at a specified position in the score.
				At least two arguments are needed: the position of the marker in milliseconds (or the "cursor" symbol) and the marker name, as symbol.
				For instance, <b>addmarker 1000 foo</b> adds a marker at 1000ms with the name "foo".
				If more than one name need to be associated to the marker, the symbol can be replaced by a list of symbols,
				for instance <b>addmarker 1000 [foo fee]</b>. If no names need to be associated to the marker, leave <b>[]</b> as
				name llll. The millisecond position can be replaced by the "cursor" symbol or by the "end" symbol (end of score). <br />
				If the marker has a role (see below), this should be stated as symbol as third argument.	The choice is among the
				following symbols: "none" (default: no role), "timesig" (time signature), "tempo", "barline" and "division".
				If the specified role requires a content, this should be indicated as fourth argument. For instance
				<b>addmarker 0 [not important] timesig [4 4]</b> adds a marker at the beginning of the <o>bach.roll</o>, having a
				time signature role, corresponding to a 4/4 time signature. <br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.

			<description>
				A <m>bang</m> in any of the inlets will first rebuild new <o>bach.roll</o> content starting from

				If the <m>autoclear</m> attribute is set to 1,

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>cents <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: cents&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>cents 6000</b>   <i>→ change selected notes to middle C's</i><br />
				• <b>cents = 6000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>cents = cents * 1.2</b>   <i>→ stretch pitches</i><br />
				• <b>cents = "random[48, 73]*100"</b>   <i>→ assign pitch randomly</i><br />
				• <b>cents = 6000 + [cents % 1200]</b>   <i>→ collapse to middle octave</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>cents</m>, followed by a number, sets the new pitch, in midicents, for all
				the selected notation items.
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded. <br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				Any of the numbers in the cents syntax can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing cents.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				Syntax: <b>changeslotitem <m>&lt;int/symbol: slot_number_or_name&gt;</m> <m>&lt;int: element_index&gt;</m> <m>&lt;llll: slot_element&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 3 2 13</b>   <i>→ set the 2nd element of 3nd (int or float) slot to 13</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 3 0 13</b>   <i>→ append 13 at the end of slot 3</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 1 2 0.5 10 0</b>   <i>→ change the 2nd point of the 1st (function) slot to (0.5 10 0) in (x y slope) form</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem active 2 0.5 10 0</b>   <i>→ the same, for the currently open slot</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem spectrenv 2 0.5 10 0</b>   <i>→ the same, for the a slot named 'spectrenv'</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 9 1 highpass 400 0 2</b>   <i>→ set the 1st element of 9nd (dynfilter) slot to "highpass 400 0 2"</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 8 0 Max.app 0</b>   <i>→ append the Max.app file in the 8th (filelist) slot, and make it active</i><br />
				• <b>changeslotitem 8 0 0 2</b>   <i>→ Make 2nd file active in 8th (filelist) slot</i><br />
				<br />
				A <m>changeslotitem</m> message will change a specific element inside a slot (possibly containing more than one element, such as
				a <m>function</m> slot, or an <m>intlist</m> slot...) of any selected note.
				The syntax is <b>changeslotitem <m>slot_number</m> <m>element_index</m> <m>SLOT_ELEMENT_CONTENT</m></b>. <br />
				Instead of the slot number, you can use slot names, or you can the word "active" to refer to the currently open slot.
				The <m>element_index</m> is the number identifying the position of the element to be changed (e.g., for a <m>function</m> slot: 1 for the first point, 2 for the second, and so on).
				The symbol "all" can replace the element index, in order to change all elements.
				The element content is a single element in the lists of the slot content syntax: a single point for a slot <m>function</m>, a single number for an <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> slot,
				and so on. Such element must be unwrapped from its outer level of parentheses (if any). For instance, for a function,
				a good syntax is <b>changeslotitem 2 3 0.5 20 0</b> which will change the 3rd point of the function contained in the second slot
				to the point <b>[0.5 20 0]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>dump <m>[&lt;list: selective_dump_options&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>dump</b>   <i>→ dump whole information from all outlets</i><br />
				• <b>dump separate</b>   <i>→ dump separate-syntax outlets only</i><br />
				• <b>dump roll</b>   <i>→ dump first outlet only (gathered syntax)</i><br />
				• <b>dump onsets</b>   <i>→ dump onsets only</i><br />
				• <b>dump velocities</b>   <i>→ dump velocities only</i><br />
				• <b>dump pitches</b>   <i>→ dump pitch information as diatonic pitches</i><br />
				• <b>dump cents</b>   <i>→ dump pitch information as MIDIcents</i><br />
				• <b>dump body</b>   <i>→ dump first outlet only, but without dumping the header</i><br />
				• <b>dump header</b>   <i>→ the same, but only dumping the header</i><br />
				• <b>dump keys clefs body</b>   <i>→ dump keys, clefs and body from first outlet</i><br />
				<br />
				A <m>dump</m> message will simply output
				the content of all separate parameters from all separate outlets (in separate syntax, right-to-left), and
				all the content of <o>bach.roll</o> in gathered syntax from the first outlet (header information included). See below to know more
				about gathered and separate syntaxes. <br />
				The <m>dump</m> message also accepts as argument one of the following symbols, which will only dump a portion of the global information: <br />
				- <b>onsets</b>: only dump the onsets (in separate syntax) from the second outlet. <br />
				- <b>cents</b>: only dump the pitches in MIDIcents form (in separate syntax) from the third outlet
				(this overrides the <m>outputpitchesseparate</m>, forcing the output to be in Cents), <br />
				- <b>pitches</b>: only dump the pitches as diatonic pitches (in separate syntax) from the third outlet
				(this overrides the <m>outputpitchesseparate</m>, forcing the output to be always diatonic pitches), <br />
				- <b>durations</b>: only dump the durations (in separate syntax) from the fourth outlet. <br />
				- <b>velocities</b>: only dump the velocities (in separate syntax) from the fifth outlet. <br />
				- <b>extras</b>: only dump the extras (in separate syntax) from the sixth outlet. <br />
				- <b>roll</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.roll</o> gathered syntax from the first outlet (and nothing from the separate parameters outlets). <br />
				- <b>body</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.roll</o> gathered syntax from the first outlet, and drop all the header specifications: only dump the
				body (content) of the <o>bach.roll</o>. <br />
				- <b>header</b>: only dump the whole <o>bach.roll</o> from the first outlet, dropping all the content (body) specification, and only
				outputting all the header specification. <br />
				Moreover, if one needs to only dump specific header elements, the <m>dump</m> message may also accept a list of symbols referring to them.
				Namely, the possibilities are the following ones: "keys", "clefs", "voicenames", "midichannels", "markers", "slotinfo", "command", "groups".
				Also the "body" symbol can always be added, in order to also dump the music content.
				For instance, <b>dump keys slotinfo voicenames</b> will dump the key signatures, the slotinfo and the voicenames,
				while, <b>dump keys slotinfo voicenames body</b> will do the same but will also output the music content (body).
				The order of the dumped elements does not correspond in general to the order of the symbols in the list.
				<br /> <br />
				The gathered syntax of a whole <o>bach.roll</o> is in the form <b>roll <m>HEADER</m> <m>BODY</m></b>, where
				the first symbol is optional as input (but always given as output). <m>HEADER</m> is an llll containing all the
				<o>bach.roll</o> meta-information (such as key signatures, clefs, markers...),
				while <m>BODY</m> has the form of a sequence of voices: <b>[<m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...]</b>
				where each voice is an llll in gathered syntax (see below for more information about this). <br /> <br />
				The header contains meta-information about the score. Such information is given in the form <b>[<m>HEADER_LLLL1</m> <m>HEADER_LLLL2</m>...]</b>
				where each <m>HEADER_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>header_element_name</m> <m>CONTENT</m>]</b>. The complete list of header element names
				and the expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>clefs</b>: introduces the used clefs; one clef symbol for each voice is expected. The number of voices is automatically
				updated to the number of clef symbols inserted.
				Since clefs can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>clefs</m> attribute.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>keys</b>: introduces the used key signatures; one key signature symbol for each voice is expected. If less are given, last one is padded.
				Since key signatures can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>keys</m> attribute.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>voicenames</b>: introduces the voice names specification, one name (atom) for each voice is expected.
				If a voice have more than one name, an llll with the list of names must be introduced. To skip names for a voice use <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b>.
				Since voice names can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>voicenames</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>midichannels</b>: introduces the MIDI channels specification, one integer for each voice is expected.
				Since MIDI channels can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>midichannels</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>stafflines</b>: set the staff lines configurations. A list of elements (one for each voice) is expected. Since staff lines can be set both as header element and
				as attribute, also see the <m>stafflines</m> attribute. Each element can be in one of the following forms:
				either <b><m>number_of_stafflines</m></b>, setting the number of stafflines for the voice, which will be distributed evenly around
				the middle line of the default staff, or a wrapped llll in the form <b>[<m>index_staff_line1</m> <m>index_staff_line2</m>...]</b>
				where each index is the position of a line to be drawn. Line 1 correspond to the bottommost staffline of a standard staff;
				line 5 correspond to the topmost staffline of a standard staff. Integers need not be positive: indices like -2 or 7 will be
				extrapolated from the standard staff. The total number of lines is thus the length of such llll.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>markers</b>: specifies the markers. A list of elements (one for each marker) is expected. For <o>bach.roll</o> markers, or for
				<o>bach.score</o> markers attached to milliseconds position, each element
				must be in the form <b>[<m>position_ms</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m> <m>role</m> <m>content</m>]</b> where the two last parameters
				are optional and only supported by <o>bach.roll</o> (ignore them in <o>bach.score</o>). The <m>position_ms</m> is a floating number
				specifying the marker position in milliseconds; the <m>marker_name(s)</m> is either a single symbol, or a wrapped llll, or
				<b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if marker has no name. For <o>bach.score</o> measure-attached markers the syntax is: <b>[<m>TIMEPOINT</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m>]</b>
				where <m>TIMEPOINT</m> identifies a time point.
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>slotinfo</b>: specifies the information about the types and the global characteristics of each slot.
				The general syntax for a slotinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[slotinfo [<m>slot_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>slot_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>,
				where the <m>slot_num</m> are the slot numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding slotinfo specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the slot numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the slotinfo
				is always output for all slots, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the slotinfo.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>name</b>: expects the name you want to give to the slot (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>type</b>: expects one of the following symbols, defining the slot type: "function", "int", "float", "intlist", "floatlist", "text",
				"filelist", "llll", "spat", "togglematrix", "intmatrix", "floatmatrix", "filter, "dynfilter", "color", "3dfunction",
				"articulations", "notehead, "dynamics", "none".  <br />
				- <b>access</b>: sets the slot accessibility, and expects a symbol. Default is "readandwrite" (slot is readable and writable);
				you can also use "readonly" (slot is only readable, not writable via interface), or "none" (slot window can't even be opened, slot
				content cannot be accessed).<br />
				- <b>temporalmode</b>: sets whether the slot contains temporal information, and if so in which form.
				It expects one of the following symbols: "none" (the information is not temporal), "relative" (the information is temporal, and the X value
				of each slot item is a relative position inside the note duration, usually between 0 and 1), "milliseconds" (the information is temporal, and the X
				value of each slot item is defined as a position milliseconds with respect to the note onset). <br />
				- <b>extend</b>: toggles the ability for temporal slots to extend their content beyond the end of each corresponding note (might be also useful,
				in combination with the "milliseconds" temporalmode, in order to define continuous parameters, independently from a note duration). <br />
				– <b>range</b>: followed by two numbers, sets the minimum and maximum values the slot range (vertical axis for function and 3dfunction slots, or number
				range for number slots) may assume. <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				– <b>slope</b>: expects a parameter (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially represent the displayed range values of the slot. <br />
				– <b>width</b>: expects a value determining the width of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). <br />
				– <b>height</b>: a value determining the height of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). You can also put "auto"
				if you want to leave an automatically calculated height (default). <br />
				– <b>ysnap</b>: sets, for function or 3dfunction slots, some privileged Y points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Alt+mousedrag. <br />
				– <b>zsnap</b>: sets, for 3function slots, some privileged Z points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Ctrl+Alt+mousedrag (mac). <br />
				– <b>domain</b>: followed by two numbers, for function and 3dfunction slots, replaces the standard 0 to 1 domain with any input domain (input numbers
				are minimum and maximum). <br />
				– <b>domainslope</b>: a slope (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially rescale the domain display. <br />
				– <b>default</b>: a numeric value (for numeric slots) determining the slot default value. <br />
				– <b>representation</b>: it could expect one of the following things. 1: Symbols defining units of measurement (e.g. "Hz", "ms"...), for numeric
				slots one symbol is expected, for function slots if one symbol is given, it is applied to the Y axis, if two symbols are given they are
				applied to the X and Y axis, for 3dfunction slots up to three symbols can be given, the third one referring to the Z axis, use <b>nil</b> or
				<b>[]</b> to skip assignment for an axis. For filter and dynfilter slots, you can assign "Hz" or "cents" as unit of measurement
				and it will be used to display the cutoff frequency accordingly. 2: An enumeration list (only for int
				and intlist slots), mapping each integer to an element of this enumeration list (e.g. in an int slot from 1 to 3, a
				slot_representation "(one two three)" will display "one" at the place of 1, "two" at the place of 2, "three" at the place of 3).
				These symbols will never be output upon dump or play, they will be just displayed. 3:
				For matrix-typed slots, it can be either a llll containing the number of rows and columns, such as (3 4), or a llll containing
				the names of the rows and columns, such as ((or fee foo) (col1 col2 col3)). To give units to different axes, just list them, such as: Hz dB.
				– <b>zrange</b>: as "range", but for the Z spatial dimension (used by the 3dfunction slot: the Z dimension is the one "coming out" from the screen). <br />
				– <b>zslope</b>: as "slope", but for the Z spatial dimention (used by the 3dfunction slot). <br />
				– <b>singleslotfortiednotes</b>: (for bach.score only) tells whether tied sequences of notes have just one slot, the one corresponding
				to the first note of the sequence. <br />
				– <b>copywhensplit</b>: tells whether this slot should be copied when a note is split into a sequence of multiple notes (e.g. via quantization). <br />
				- <b>follownotehead</b>: forces to automatically modify the value of the slot depending on the notehead trimming (useful if the slot
				value is something associated to the notehead, such as the starting point for reading a sample).<br />
				<br />
				You are not obliged to input all the fields: you can give as input only the required fields.
				Also at output, only the needed fields are given (e.g. the "zrange" is only output for 3dfunction slots, and so on).
				Setting an individual field for a given will not change any other field, unless the type is changed, in which case
				a conversion on all the slots is performed (if possible, i.e. if slots are compatible) otherwise the slot data of the given slot is lost.
				While converting slots, also some other fields may be changed to default values for the new slot type. <br />
				Some more fields can be set via the slotinfo. These fields are never retrieved when the slotinfo is queried via a
				<m>dump</m> message, since they correspond to standard attribute values of the notation object: <br />
				- <b>background</b>: this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to be constantly painted in the background or 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>bgslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>popup</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to show up in the note+popup+menu, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>popupmenuslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>rightclick</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one wants that the right click (or two-fingers tap) on a note head directly
				pops up the slot window of the current slot, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>rightclickslot</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>linkto</b> (except bach.slot): this field defines the possible slot linkage. Slot linkage is a way to entangle some notation or
				display features to the content of a given slot. You can specify here to which feature the slot should be linked,
				via one of the following symbols: "none", "lyrics", "notecolor", "noteheadadjust", "noteheadchar", "noteheadfont", "notesize". <br />
				<br />
				– <b>commands</b>: specifies the information about the commands. A list of elements (one for each command) is expected.
				The general syntax for an llll defining commands in a notation object header is:
				<b>[commands [<m>command_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>command_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>
				where the <m>command_num1</m> are the command numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding command specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the command numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the commands
				are always output for all commands, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the commands.
				The list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>note</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "note" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>chord</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "chord" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>rest</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "rest" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>groups</b>: (<o>bach.roll</o> only) specifies the information about the grouped chords.
				Although bach.roll syntax, as everything in bach, is transparent (and you are thus allowed to modify any element),
				there are extremely few cases where you might need to set manually the group information in llll form.
				Usually, such information is only dealt with via the interface (i.e. by grouping and ungrouping things),
				and the group header element is only a way to embed or save such information with the object.
				Nevertheless, nothing in principle prevents you from setting groups via message. The syntax is the following one:
				<b>[groups <m>GROUP1</m> <m>GROUP2</m>...]</b>, where each <m>GROUP</m> is an llll having the syntax
				<b>[<m>ADDRESS_CHORD1</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD2</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD3</m>...]</b>, where each address llll identifies one of the
				chord inside the groups, via the following syntax: <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>,
				where the chord index is the position of the chord inside the sequence of chords of the voice (ordered by onsets).
				– <b>articulationinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined articulation.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION1</m> <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom articulation to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "myfermata"). <br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "myf"). <br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots. <br />

				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications determine the characters used:
				– <b>mainchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the main articulation character (above notes). <br />
				– <b>flippedchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the flipped articulation character (below notes). <br />
				– <b>extchar</b>: symbol or unicode value of the articulation extension, if any (e.g.: the tilde in a trill line). <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom:
				– <b>mainxshift</b>, <b>mainyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the main character (positive y shift moves up). <br />
				– <b>flippedxshift</b>, <b>flippedyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the flipped character. <br />
				– <b>mainheight</b>, <b>flippedheight</b>: height of the main and flipped characters. <br />
				– <b>mainycenter</b>, <b>flippedycenter</b>: position of the vertical center of the articulation for main and flipped char. <br />
				– <b>outsidestaffynudge</b>: additional y shift to push articulation farther from staff. <br />
				– <b>extyshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the articulation extensions. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will set the markings used when exporting articulations to MusicXML format:
				– <b>xmlornament</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML ornament whenever the articulation is found, or "none" if no export needed (default). <br />
				– <b>xmltechnical</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML technical tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-technical" type, defining a custom technical tag.<br />
				– <b>xmlarticulations</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML articulation tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-articulation" type, defining a custom articulation tag.<br />
				<br />
				Finally, one can assign an option specification, possibly followed by a list of symbols, to set some flags.
				Symbols must be among the following ones:<br />
				· <b>avoidlines</b>: avoid staff lines.<br />
				· <b>outsidestaff</b>: always place outside staff.<br />
				· <b>centerovernote</b>: center over the notehead.<br />

				<br />
				– <b>noteheadinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined noteheads.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD1</m> <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom notehead to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "curly").<br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "cr").<br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots.<br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "notationfont").<br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation).<br />
				– <b>char</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the notehead character. If two values are input, they refer respectively to the "black" and "white" flavours
				(assigned <o>bach.score</o> to black and white notes). If three values are input, they refer respectively to "black", "white" and "whole note" flavours.
				If four values are input they refer respectively to "black", "white", "whole note" and "double whole note". <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom: <br />
				– <b>xshift</b>: horizontal shift (positive values move right). <br />
				– <b>yshift</b>: vertical shift (positive values move up). <br />
				– <b>width</b>: the width of the notehead. <br />
				– <b>xshiftsmall</b>: same as xshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>yshiftsmall</b>: same as yshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>dlstartxshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the duration line. <br />
				<br />
				– <b>numparts</b>: specifies the information about the part assignment (see <m>numparts</m> attribute).
				– <b>loop</b>: specifies the information about the loop, as for the <m>loop</m> attribute, as a starting and ending point (in milliseconds, or as timepoints).
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD1</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, onsets are the only parameter assigned chordwise (they are a propriety of chords, rather than notes).
				The separate syntax for onsets will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing a value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[0 1000 2000 3000] [100 400] [250 2500]</b>. <br />
				Cents, durations, velocities and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.roll</o> (they are propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [[5500] [5400]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.roll</o> can properly understand
				<b>[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [5500 5400]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut.
				<br /> <br />
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

		<method name="dumpnotepixelpos">
			<arg name="query_label" optional="1" type="llll" />
			<digest>
				Retrieve pixel position of every chord and note
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>dumpnotepixelpos <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The <m>dumpnotepixelpos</m> message retrieves the pixel position of any chord and note, and outputs it from the playout.
				The output answer has the syntax:
				<b>notepixelpos <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll of the form
				<b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>...]</b>, and where each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll accounting for the pixel position of the chord
				and all its notes, in the form:
				<b>(<m>x-pixel_onset</m> (<m>duration_in_horizontal_pixels_note1</m>  <m>duration_in_horizontal_pixels_note2</m> ...)
				(<m>y_pixel_noteheadcenter_note1</m>   <m>y_pixel_noteheadcenter_note2</m> ...)
				(<m>x_pixel_accidental_left_position_note1</m> <m>x_pixel_accidental_left_position_note2</m> ...))</b>.
				The <m>x-pixel_onset</m> is the pixel corresponding to the chord onset; each <m>duration_in_horizontal_pixels_note</m> is the
				length of eachnote duration line in pixels; each <m>y_pixel_noteheadcenter_note</m> is the vertical position (in pixels) of the center
				of the noteheads, and each <m>x_pixel_accidental_left_position_note</m> is the pixel position of the left boundary of the leftmost accidental
				for each note (or, if a note has no accidentals, the leftmost point of the notehead). <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

				Play selected items off-line

			<description>
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@router</m> (llll, default: null): Sets a forced router to be used instead of the default one<br />
				<br />
				The <m>dumpselection</m> message sends the content of each one of selected notation items from the
				playout, in playout syntax (off-line play).
				You can safely rely on the fact that elements will be output ordered by onset. <br />
				If a "router" message attribute is set, then the standard router ("note", "chord") is replaced by the specified one;
				if the "router" attribute has length 2, the first symbol will be used for notes, the second one for chords. <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Retrieve pixel position of every voice
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>dumpvoicepixelpos <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The <m>dumpvoicepixelpos</m> message retrieves the pixel position of any voices, and outputs it from the playout.
				The output answer has the syntax:
				<b>voicepixelpos <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>, where each <m>VOICE</m> is an llll of the form
				<b>[<m>y_pixel_middleC</m> <m>y_pixel_bottom_staffline</m> <m>y-pixel_top_staffline</m>]</b>. The three values are: the vertical position
				in pixels of the middle C, and the bottommost and topmost staffline position (in pixels). <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

		<method name="duration">
			<arg name="duration" optional="0" type="number/llll/anything" />
			<digest>
				Modify the duration of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>duration <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: duration&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>duration 1000</b>   <i>→ change duration of selected items to 1s</i><br />
				• <b>duration = 1000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>duration = duration - 1000</b>   <i>→ reduce duration by 1s</i><br />
				• <b>duration = 30000 - onset</b>   <i>→ make selection end together at 30s</i><br />
				• <b>duration = velocity * 2</b>   <i>→ assign durations depending on velocity</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>duration</m>, followed by a number, sets the new duration, in milliseconds, for all
				the selected notation items.
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded.
				Any of the numbers can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing duration.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				• <b>dynamics2velocities @exp 1.</b>   <i>→ use a linear mapping curve</i><br />
				<br />
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@maxchars</m> (int, default: 4): Width of the dynamics spectrum<br />
				<m>@exp</m> (float, default: 0.8): Exponent for the conversion<br />
				<m>@mapping</m> (llll): Custom dynamics-to-velocity mapping via <b>[<m>dynamics</m> <m>velocity</m>]</b> pairs<br />
				<m>@breakpointmode</m> (int, default: 0): Breakpoint handling (0 = handle existing ones, 1 = add new ones to match dynamics, 2 = also clear)<br />
				<br />
				A <m>dynamics2velocities</m> message will assign all the note velocities (and pitch breakpoint velocity,
				if <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> is non-zero), depending on the current dynamics and hairpins, for the whole score or - if
				"selection" is set as first argument, for the selected items only. The dynamics sequence considered is the one contained in the slot
				linked to dynamics, if any (see <m>linkdynamicstoslot</m>), or in another slot, if given as integer argument. <br />
				Unless explicit dynamic-velocity mapping is defined, a default mapping is used. Two message attributes handle such default mapping: <br />
				• the "maxchars" attribute sets the width of the dynamics spectrum; <br />
				• the "exp" attribute sets the exponent for the conversion. <br />
				The dynamics spectrum is the sequence of standard dynamics in the piano-to-forte range.
				It is characterized by its "maxchars", i.e. the maximum number of p's and f's of the elements it contains ("mp" and "mf"
				are considered as having 0 p's and f's).
				For instance, the collection of
				{"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"} makes for a spectrum of <m>maxchars</m> = 2.
				The "maxchars" property of the dynamic spectrum will factor into different conversions between dynamics and velocities,
				in combination with a conversion exponent.
				The dynamic range is set via the "maxchars" parameter, while the exponent is set via the "exp" parameter (greater than 0. and less or equal to 1.).
				If "exp" is 1., the velocity range is divided linearly between the dynamics in the spectrum; otherwise an exponential scaling is applied.
				Default exponent is 0.8, and default range width is 5 (from "pppp" to "ffff").
				Any dynamic marking outside the spectrum will be clipped to the spectrum during conversion.
				The dynamics are scaled so that "mp" will always correspond to velocity = 64.
				If i is the index of the
				If <m>i</m> is the 1-based index of the element of a spectrum containing 2D elements <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(-1+2i/(2D+1))*|-1+2i/(2D+1)|^a)/2)^b <br />
				More clearly, once set x = x(i, D) = -1+2i/(2D+1), between -1 and 1, one has <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(x)*|x|^a)/2)^b. <br />
				This function assumes values between 0. and 1., for x in [-1, 1].
				In any case vel(i) is clipped to 127 (128 won't be allowed).
				The parameter <m>a</m> is the "exp" parameter defined above. The parameter <m>b</m> is chosen so that vel("mp") = vel(D) = 64, which yields <br />
				b = 1/(1 - log2(1 - 1/((2D+1)^a))) <br />
				As an example, if "exp" (i.e. <m>a</m>) is 0.8 (hence <m>b</m> is about 0.745),
				consider the spectrum {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 2 and <m>D</m> = 3 (containing <m>2D</m> = 6 elements).
				The dynamics "f" has index 5, hence x = x(5, 3) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 10/7 = 3/7, hence <br />
				vel("f") = vel(5) = 128 * ((1 + (3/7)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.810 ~ 103, <br />
				while within the broader spectrum {"pppp", "ppp", "pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff", "fff", "ffff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 4 and <m>D</m> = 5,
				one has x = x(7, 5) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 14/11 = 3/11
				vel("f") = vel(7) = 128 * ((1 + (3/11)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.748 ~ 96. <br />
				Moreover, the "mapping" attribute defines a non-standard or more general mapping via an llll specification. Such parameter has syntax
				<b>[<m>dynamics1</m> <m>velocity1</m>] [<m>dynamics2</m> <m>velocity2</m>]</b>.
				You might also define a the dynamics association you want to drift from the default values; any other marking which does not show up in the
				mapping will be converted via the default conversion equation.

				listed, in the form <b>[<m>name1</m> <m>name2</m> ...]</b>, where each <m>name</m> is a symbol or an integer. If a marker has no name,

				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.

				A <m>gluechord</m> message acts exactly like an <m>addchord</m> message, which an important difference:
				it glues the introduced chord, whenever possible, to existing notes. More precisely: if an already existing note is
				the "same" as one of the newly introduced notes, and has the tail "near" the onset of the newly introduced chord, then
				instead of creating a new note, the existing note is made longer.
				If a first integer argument is given, this is the voice number to which the new chord should be assigned; if no integer is given as
				first argument, the first voice will be used by default.
				Then an llll with the chord gathered syntax is expected. Two more optional final arguments can be given, specifying
				what the previously used word "same" and "near" mean. Such arguments are indeed two thresholds: a threshold in milliseconds
				(notes can be glued only if the existing note tail and the new note onset are less distant than this threshold), and a threshold
				in midicents (notes can be glued only if the existing note pitch and the new note pitch are less distant than this threshold). <br />
				A fifth argument can be given, representing a smooth period in milliseconds. If this number is greater than 0, then if there
				are discontinuities at glue point, such discontinuities are eased along the defined number of milliseconds. Such argument can also
				be defined as "inf" (symbol), in which case the newly added point at the discontinuity is dropped.
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				<m>@until</m> (llll, default: null): Sets a condition to be matched, otherwise perform the command again, until condition is met<br />
				<br />
				The <m>goto</m> message moves the selection to new items, i.e. clears the selection and select the new item. <br />
				The first argument is the go-to command, which can be one of the following symbols: <br />
				• "up", "down", "left", "right": move selection up/down/left/right, as you would with the editing
				keyboard arrows (+ Command or Control) <br />
				• "next", "prev": move selection to the following or previous elements <br />
				• "time" or "timepoint": move selection to a given point in time (either in milliseconds or as a timepoint).
				An argument is expected, either a number (millisecond position) or a timepoint, in llll form (see below for timepoint syntax). <br />
				<br />
				In addition, a certain number of behaviors can be changed via the following message attributes:
				• "repeat": expects an integer, setting the number of times for the command to be repeated. <br />
				• "nullmode": if non-zero, also notifies when there is no (longer) selection, e.g. at the end of a "next" go-to chain. <br />
				• "skiprests": if non-zero, avoids the rest while performing the selection. <br />
				• "inscreen": if non-zero, also puts the selected items inside the displayed portion of the domain. <br />
				• "voices": sets the voicenumbers for the voices to be accounted for; default is the empty llll, meaning: all voices. <br />
				• "where": sets a mathematical condition to be applied to sieve the selection each time the command is performed. Variables are the same
				as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
				• "until": sets a mathematical condition that, if not matched, will cause the command to be re-executed, until the condition is met.
				Variables are the same as in the <m>sel note if</m> case. <br />
				• "untilmode": a symbol, either "any" or "all", determining whether the <m>until</m> condition should be applied to all selected elements in order
				to be considered met, or to anyone of them (i.e. at least one). <br />
				• "type": sets a list of notation item types (as symbols) to be accounted for, among: "note", "rest", "marker", "tempo", "measure", "voice". <br />
				• "markershavevoices": if non-zero, considers measure-attached markers as belonging to the corresponding voice (and hence accounts for it
				while using the <m>voicemode</m> and <m>voices</m> message attributes). <br />
				• "graceshavedur": if non-zero, considers grace notes as having a (minimal) duration, precisely the one attributed to them by the <o>bach.score</o>
				playback system, and controllable via the related attributes. <br />
				• "tiemode": one of the following symbols, defining how selection behaves with respect to ties: <br />
				- "each": each element in a tie sequence is independent, and can be independently selected; <br />
				- "all" (default): whenever an element in a tie sequence is to be selected, all the other elements are selected too. <br />
				<br />
				For the "time" command only: <br />
				• "include": for the "time" command only: expects one or two symbols among "head" and "tail" in order to determine what extreme should be included
				when it falls exactly on the timepoint (default: head). <br />
				For the "next"/"prev" commands only: <br />
				• "voicemode": a symbol determining how the selection should be performed across different voices. Allowed values are: <br />
				- "each": go-to command is performed in each voice independently (e.g.: all voices go to next selected chord, independently); <br />
				- "any": go-to command is performed on the next/previous element, no matter in which voice it is. The sequence will walk through all
				chords in all voices; <br />
				- "all": go-to command is performed accounting for selection in all voices, but selection is allowed to always jump, starting from the
				last reached onset or tail; <br />
				- "anyactive" (default): like "any", but only applied on the voices having some selected element; <br />
				- "allactive": like "all", but only applied on the voices having some selected element. <br />
				• "polymode": a symbol determining how the polyphony should be handled. Allowed values are: <br />
				- "none": don't account for polyphony, i.e. don't "hold" (keep selected) previously selected chords; <br />
				- "overlap" (default): keep previously selected chords if they overlap with the new selection. This yields a standard walkthrough of the score; <br />
				- "overhang": keep previously selected chords if they are "temporally contained" in the new selection (i.e. if the new selection starts before
				their onset and ends after their tail). <br />
				• "from", "to": symbols (among "auto", "head" and "tail") determining from and to which point the selection should be computed.
				For instance going to the "next" chord from a given selection means, by default, looking at the farthermost selected notehead
				and searching for the first chords
				whose notehead lies after that, i.e. we search from a head to another head. The opposite is true, by default, when going to "prev" chords:
				we search from the leftmost tail the nearest previous one. This is the behavior with "from" and "to" attributes set to "auto".
				One could change these behaviors by setting "from" and "to" explicitly to some other element ("head" or "tail"). <br />
				<br />
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.

				Syntax: <b>insertvoice <m>&lt;int: voice_number&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;llll: voice_or_ref&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>insertvoice 2</b>   <i>→ insert a empty voice as 2nd voice</i><br />
				• <b>insertvoice 2 4</b>   <i>→ also initialize it with the properties of 4th voice</i><br />

				<br />
				An <m>insertvoice</m> message, followed by an integer number <m>N</m>, will create a new voice and insert it as the <m>N</m>-th voice
				of the current score. If a second llll argument is set, this can be either an integer, specifying the number of reference voice from where
				the measureinfo should be copied (hence the new voice will be filled with empty measures, according to the specified reference voice),
				or an llll, containing the gathered syntax of the whole new voice, so that the new voice comes also
				filled with musical content. <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD1</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Example: <b>interp 1000</b>   <i>→ get info on chords being played at 1s</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>interp</m> message, followed by a time value (in milliseconds) retrieves
				the instantaneous data of all the notes which are active at the given time instant.
				The answer is sent through the playout in the following form: <b>interp <m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...</b>
				where each <m>VOICE</m> is in the form <b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD2</m>...]</b>, being the chords active at the
				given time instant, each in the form <b>[<m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>...]</b>, being the chord notes active at
				the given time instant, each in the standard note gathered syntax, with two important variations:
				there is no duration element, and for each slot marked as temporal only the slot element at the given time instant
				is output (e.g. the interpolated function point of a function slot). <br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never

				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint

				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Perform operation on individual selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>lambda <m>&lt;llll: modification_message&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>lamdba cents $1</b>   <i>→ assign the incoming value as note cents</i><br />
				• <b>lamdba changeslotitem $1 $2 $3</b>   <i>→ the same, for some slot value</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>lambda</m> message is a general router which can be prepended to all the following operations:
				<m>cents</m>, <m>velocity</m>, <m>onset</m>, <m>tail</m>, <m>duration</m>, <m>voice</m>, <m>addbreakpoint</m>, <m>erasebreakpoint</m>,
				<m>addslot</m>, <m>changeslotitem</m>, <m>eraseslot</m>, <m>name</m>.
				If such router is prepended, the corresponding operation will apply on the currently output selected item.
				The idea is that when a selection dump is asked or a command is sent (also see <m>dumpselection</m> or <m>sendcommand</m>), the notation
				elements are output one by one from the playout (notewise or chordwise depending on the <m>playmode</m>): if you put a feedback loop from the playout
				to the <o>bach.roll</o>, changing one of the previously defined parameter, but prepending the "lambda" symbol inside the message,
				such modification will not apply to the whole selection, but only to the item currently being output. In such a way, you can modify
				chords one by one, depending on their parameters, even by performing a collective selection dump.
				Such feedback cycle must not have any <o>delay</o> nor <o>pipe</o> nor <o>defer</o> nor <o>deferlow</o>, nor anything which may change the thread
				or defer the modification operation. See #lambda+operation in the help center to have some examples of usage.

				Syntax: <b>legato <m>[&lt;symbol: trim_or_extend&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>legato</b>   <i>→ make selection monophonic, with no rests</i><br />
				• <b>legato trim</b>   <i>→ the same, preserving rests</i><br />
				• <b>legato extend</b>   <i>→ the same, preserving notes superpositions</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>legato</m> message shifts the tails of each one of the selected notes so that it reaches exactly the
				onset of the following chord, resulting in a sequence of chords where each one ends when the next one begins. <br />
				If the <b>trim</b> symbol is given as first argument, the legato will only shorten the notes duration, hence preserving
				all rests between chords. If the <b>extend</b> symbol is given as first argument, the legato will only make note durations longer,
				hence preserving all superposition of notes across chords.

				Function depends on inlet
			</digest>
			<description>
				In the first inlet, an llll is expected to be a gathered syntax content of the entire <o>bach.roll</o> (building
				the new <o>bach.roll</o> content from scratch), or an llll containing just some header specification
				(thus not affecting the body of the object). See below for more information on the gathered syntax. <br />
				In any of the other inlets, an llll is expected to contain the separate syntax of some parameter. Namely: <br />
				- second inlet: Onsets <br />
				- third inlet: Pitches or cents <br />
				- fourth inlet: Durations <br />
				- fifth inlet: Velocities <br />
				- sixth inlet: Extras <br />
				See below for more information about the separate syntax. Also see the <m>bang</m> method to rebuild content from these separate
				parameters.<br /> <br />
				The gathered syntax of a whole <o>bach.roll</o> is in the form <b>roll <m>HEADER</m> <m>BODY</m></b>, where
				the first symbol is optional as input (but always given as output). <m>HEADER</m> is an llll containing all the
				<o>bach.roll</o> meta-information (such as key signatures, clefs, markers...),
				while <m>BODY</m> has the form of a sequence of voices: <b>[<m>VOICE1</m> <m>VOICE2</m>...]</b>
				where each voice is an llll in gathered syntax (see below for more information about this). <br /> <br />
				The header contains meta-information about the score. Such information is given in the form <b>[<m>HEADER_LLLL1</m> <m>HEADER_LLLL2</m>...]</b>
				where each <m>HEADER_LLLL</m> is in the form <b>[<m>header_element_name</m> <m>CONTENT</m>]</b>. The complete list of header element names
				and the expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>clefs</b>: introduces the used clefs; one clef symbol for each voice is expected. The number of voices is automatically
				updated to the number of clef symbols inserted.
				Since clefs can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>clefs</m> attribute.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>keys</b>: introduces the used key signatures; one key signature symbol for each voice is expected. If less are given, last one is padded.
				Since key signatures can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>keys</m> attribute.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>voicenames</b>: introduces the voice names specification, one name (atom) for each voice is expected.
				If a voice have more than one name, an llll with the list of names must be introduced. To skip names for a voice use <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b>.
				Since voice names can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>voicenames</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>midichannels</b>: introduces the MIDI channels specification, one integer for each voice is expected.
				Since MIDI channels can be set both as header element and as attribute, also see the <m>midichannels</m> attribute.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>stafflines</b>: set the staff lines configurations. A list of elements (one for each voice) is expected. Since staff lines can be set both as header element and
				as attribute, also see the <m>stafflines</m> attribute. Each element can be in one of the following forms:
				either <b><m>number_of_stafflines</m></b>, setting the number of stafflines for the voice, which will be distributed evenly around
				the middle line of the default staff, or a wrapped llll in the form <b>[<m>index_staff_line1</m> <m>index_staff_line2</m>...]</b>
				where each index is the position of a line to be drawn. Line 1 correspond to the bottommost staffline of a standard staff;
				line 5 correspond to the topmost staffline of a standard staff. Integers need not be positive: indices like -2 or 7 will be
				extrapolated from the standard staff. The total number of lines is thus the length of such llll.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>markers</b>: specifies the markers. A list of elements (one for each marker) is expected. For <o>bach.roll</o> markers, or for
				<o>bach.score</o> markers attached to milliseconds position, each element
				must be in the form <b>[<m>position_ms</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m> <m>role</m> <m>content</m>]</b> where the two last parameters
				are optional and only supported by <o>bach.roll</o> (ignore them in <o>bach.score</o>). The <m>position_ms</m> is a floating number
				specifying the marker position in milliseconds; the <m>marker_name(s)</m> is either a single symbol, or a wrapped llll, or
				<b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if marker has no name. For <o>bach.score</o> measure-attached markers the syntax is: <b>[<m>TIMEPOINT</m> <m>marker_name[s]</m>]</b>
				where <m>TIMEPOINT</m> identifies a time point.
				A timepoint represents a given instant inside <o>bach.score</o>, as a measure-attached position.
				It identifies such point according to a measure, a position inside such measure,
				and possibly a voice (in case tempi and time signatures are not synchronous for all voices).
				Differently from absolute millisecond positions,
				timepoints are represented by lllls, in one of the following syntaxes: <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m>]</b>: represents the point is at the beginning of the measure identified by the introduced measure number, in the first voice.
				For instance, <b>[4]</b> represents the point at the very beginning of measure 4, voice 1. <br />
				- <b>[<m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number (in the first voice),
				but not necessarily at the beginning, rather at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 1, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. <br />
				- <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>]</b>: represents the point inside the measure identified by the introduced measure number,
				in the voice identified, by the introduced voice number, at the generic position in measure identified by the symbolic onset <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m>.
				For instance, <b>[2 4 1/4]</b> represents the point at measure 4, voice 2, after 1/4 from the beginning of the measure. Specifying voice numbers explicitly is especially
				important if voices don't have the same tempi or time signatures.
				<br />
				A timepoint can also  be specified via a <b>[<m>float_measure_number</m>]</b>, representing the point in a floating
				point position between two measures (referred to the first voice). For instance, <b>[4.2]</b> represents the point at the 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				Furthermore, the <m>sym_onset_in_measure</m> can be replaced by a float between 0 and 1 to represent a point between the beginning (0) and the end
				of the measure (1); for instance <b>[1 4 0.2]</b> represents the point after 20% of measure 4, voice 1.
				<br />
				If the measure number is replaced by the <b>any</b> symbol, then the following rational is interpreted as a global symbolic onset inside the score.
				For instance, <b>[any 27/4]</b> represents the point at 27/4 after the beginning of the score, referred to the measureinfo of voice 1;
				<b>[3 any 27/4]</b> does the same for voice 3.
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>slotinfo</b>: specifies the information about the types and the global characteristics of each slot.
				The general syntax for a slotinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[slotinfo [<m>slot_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>slot_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>,
				where the <m>slot_num</m> are the slot numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding slotinfo specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the slot numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the slotinfo
				is always output for all slots, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the slotinfo.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>name</b>: expects the name you want to give to the slot (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>type</b>: expects one of the following symbols, defining the slot type: "function", "int", "float", "intlist", "floatlist", "text",
				"filelist", "llll", "spat", "togglematrix", "intmatrix", "floatmatrix", "filter, "dynfilter", "color", "3dfunction",
				"articulations", "notehead, "dynamics", "none".  <br />
				- <b>access</b>: sets the slot accessibility, and expects a symbol. Default is "readandwrite" (slot is readable and writable);
				you can also use "readonly" (slot is only readable, not writable via interface), or "none" (slot window can't even be opened, slot
				content cannot be accessed).<br />
				- <b>temporalmode</b>: sets whether the slot contains temporal information, and if so in which form.
				It expects one of the following symbols: "none" (the information is not temporal), "relative" (the information is temporal, and the X value
				of each slot item is a relative position inside the note duration, usually between 0 and 1), "milliseconds" (the information is temporal, and the X
				value of each slot item is defined as a position milliseconds with respect to the note onset). <br />
				- <b>extend</b>: toggles the ability for temporal slots to extend their content beyond the end of each corresponding note (might be also useful,
				in combination with the "milliseconds" temporalmode, in order to define continuous parameters, independently from a note duration). <br />
				– <b>range</b>: followed by two numbers, sets the minimum and maximum values the slot range (vertical axis for function and 3dfunction slots, or number
				range for number slots) may assume. <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				– <b>slope</b>: expects a parameter (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially represent the displayed range values of the slot. <br />
				– <b>width</b>: expects a value determining the width of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). <br />
				– <b>height</b>: a value determining the height of the slot window (scaled according to the object's vertical zoom). You can also put "auto"
				if you want to leave an automatically calculated height (default). <br />
				– <b>ysnap</b>: sets, for function or 3dfunction slots, some privileged Y points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Alt+mousedrag. <br />
				– <b>zsnap</b>: sets, for 3function slots, some privileged Z points to which the points will be snapped
				upon Shift+Ctrl+Alt+mousedrag (mac). <br />
				– <b>domain</b>: followed by two numbers, for function and 3dfunction slots, replaces the standard 0 to 1 domain with any input domain (input numbers
				are minimum and maximum). <br />
				– <b>domainslope</b>: a slope (-1 to 1, 0 = linear) to exponentially rescale the domain display. <br />
				– <b>default</b>: a numeric value (for numeric slots) determining the slot default value. <br />
				– <b>representation</b>: it could expect one of the following things. 1: Symbols defining units of measurement (e.g. "Hz", "ms"...), for numeric
				slots one symbol is expected, for function slots if one symbol is given, it is applied to the Y axis, if two symbols are given they are
				applied to the X and Y axis, for 3dfunction slots up to three symbols can be given, the third one referring to the Z axis, use <b>nil</b> or
				<b>[]</b> to skip assignment for an axis. For filter and dynfilter slots, you can assign "Hz" or "cents" as unit of measurement
				and it will be used to display the cutoff frequency accordingly. 2: An enumeration list (only for int
				and intlist slots), mapping each integer to an element of this enumeration list (e.g. in an int slot from 1 to 3, a
				slot_representation "(one two three)" will display "one" at the place of 1, "two" at the place of 2, "three" at the place of 3).
				These symbols will never be output upon dump or play, they will be just displayed. 3:
				For matrix-typed slots, it can be either a llll containing the number of rows and columns, such as (3 4), or a llll containing
				the names of the rows and columns, such as ((or fee foo) (col1 col2 col3)). To give units to different axes, just list them, such as: Hz dB.
				– <b>zrange</b>: as "range", but for the Z spatial dimension (used by the 3dfunction slot: the Z dimension is the one "coming out" from the screen). <br />
				– <b>zslope</b>: as "slope", but for the Z spatial dimention (used by the 3dfunction slot). <br />
				– <b>singleslotfortiednotes</b>: (for bach.score only) tells whether tied sequences of notes have just one slot, the one corresponding
				to the first note of the sequence. <br />
				– <b>copywhensplit</b>: tells whether this slot should be copied when a note is split into a sequence of multiple notes (e.g. via quantization). <br />
				- <b>follownotehead</b>: forces to automatically modify the value of the slot depending on the notehead trimming (useful if the slot
				value is something associated to the notehead, such as the starting point for reading a sample).<br />
				<br />
				You are not obliged to input all the fields: you can give as input only the required fields.
				Also at output, only the needed fields are given (e.g. the "zrange" is only output for 3dfunction slots, and so on).
				Setting an individual field for a given will not change any other field, unless the type is changed, in which case
				a conversion on all the slots is performed (if possible, i.e. if slots are compatible) otherwise the slot data of the given slot is lost.
				While converting slots, also some other fields may be changed to default values for the new slot type. <br />
				Some more fields can be set via the slotinfo. These fields are never retrieved when the slotinfo is queried via a
				<m>dump</m> message, since they correspond to standard attribute values of the notation object: <br />
				- <b>background</b>: this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to be constantly painted in the background or 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>bgslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>popup</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one needs the slot to show up in the note+popup+menu, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>popupmenuslots</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>rightclick</b> (except bach.slot): this should be set to 1 if one wants that the right click (or two-fingers tap) on a note head directly
				pops up the slot window of the current slot, or to 0 otherwise.
				This information is constantly synchronized with the <m>rightclickslot</m> attribute. <br />
				- <b>linkto</b> (except bach.slot): this field defines the possible slot linkage. Slot linkage is a way to entangle some notation or
				display features to the content of a given slot. You can specify here to which feature the slot should be linked,
				via one of the following symbols: "none", "lyrics", "notecolor", "noteheadadjust", "noteheadchar", "noteheadfont", "notesize". <br />
				<br />
				– <b>commands</b>: specifies the information about the commands. A list of elements (one for each command) is expected.
				The general syntax for an llll defining commands in a notation object header is:
				<b>[commands [<m>command_num1</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS1</m>] [<m>command_num2</m> <m>SPECIFICATIONS2</m>]...]</b>
				where the <m>command_num1</m> are the command numbers (1 to 30), followed by their corresponding command specification. You don't need to give the information about all slots
				at input (only the one that you will use), nor the command numbers have to be sorted in any way. On the other hand, at output, the commands
				are always output for all commands, sorted in ascending order.
				Each <m>SPECIFICATIONS</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is a symbol followed by some content specifying a field of the commands.
				The list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>note</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "note" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>chord</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "chord" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>rest</b>: expects the symbol which will replace the "rest" symbol in the playout (given as a unique symbol). <br />
				– <b>key</b>: expects the character or the ASCII value of a key to be mapped as a hotkey for the slot. <br />
				<br /> <br />
				– <b>groups</b>: (<o>bach.roll</o> only) specifies the information about the grouped chords.
				Although bach.roll syntax, as everything in bach, is transparent (and you are thus allowed to modify any element),
				there are extremely few cases where you might need to set manually the group information in llll form.
				Usually, such information is only dealt with via the interface (i.e. by grouping and ungrouping things),
				and the group header element is only a way to embed or save such information with the object.
				Nevertheless, nothing in principle prevents you from setting groups via message. The syntax is the following one:
				<b>[groups <m>GROUP1</m> <m>GROUP2</m>...]</b>, where each <m>GROUP</m> is an llll having the syntax
				<b>[<m>ADDRESS_CHORD1</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD2</m> <m>ADDRESS_CHORD3</m>...]</b>, where each address llll identifies one of the
				chord inside the groups, via the following syntax: <b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>,
				where the chord index is the position of the chord inside the sequence of chords of the voice (ordered by onsets).
				– <b>articulationinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined articulation.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION1</m> <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMARTICULATION</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom articulation to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "myfermata"). <br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "myf"). <br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots. <br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "articulationsfont"). <br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation). <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				– <b>position</b>: one of the following symbols: "abovenote", "belownote", "noteside", "stemsidenearnotehead", "stemsidenearflag", "manual", determining the position of the articulation. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications determine the characters used:
				– <b>mainchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the main articulation character (above notes). <br />
				– <b>flippedchar</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the flipped articulation character (below notes). <br />
				– <b>extchar</b>: symbol or unicode value of the articulation extension, if any (e.g.: the tilde in a trill line). <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom:
				– <b>mainxshift</b>, <b>mainyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the main character (positive y shift moves up). <br />
				– <b>flippedxshift</b>, <b>flippedyshift</b>: x and y shift of positioning for the flipped character. <br />
				– <b>mainheight</b>, <b>flippedheight</b>: height of the main and flipped characters. <br />
				– <b>mainycenter</b>, <b>flippedycenter</b>: position of the vertical center of the articulation for main and flipped char. <br />
				– <b>outsidestaffynudge</b>: additional y shift to push articulation farther from staff. <br />
				– <b>extyshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the articulation extensions. <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will set the markings used when exporting articulations to MusicXML format:
				– <b>xmlornament</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML ornament whenever the articulation is found, or "none" if no export needed (default). <br />
				– <b>xmltechnical</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML technical tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-technical" type, defining a custom technical tag.<br />
				– <b>xmlarticulations</b>: text to be exported as MusicXML articulation tag whenever the articulation is found,
				or "none" if no export needed (default), or "custom" if export must be of "other-articulation" type, defining a custom articulation tag.<br />
				<br />
				Finally, one can assign an option specification, possibly followed by a list of symbols, to set some flags.
				Symbols must be among the following ones:<br />
				· <b>avoidlines</b>: avoid staff lines.<br />
				· <b>outsidestaff</b>: always place outside staff.<br />
				· <b>centerovernote</b>: center over the notehead.<br />
				· <b>centeroverstem</b>: center over the stem.<br />
				· <b>spanties</b>: articulation extension spans sequences of tied notes.<br />
				· copywhencloned: copy articulation while copying notes.<br />
				· copywhenclonedtosamechord: copy articulation while copying notes, and also when copying notes into the same chord.<br />
				· copywhensplit: copy articulation to all notes when notes are split, or retranscribed as tied sequences.<br />
				· shiftwithbeams: shift vertically according to beams.<br />
				<br />
				– <b>noteheadinfo</b>: specifies the information about custom defined noteheads.
				The general syntax for the articulationinfo llll in a notation object header is: <b>[articulationinfo <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD1</m> <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD2</m>...]</b>.
				Each <m>CUSTOMNOTEHEAD</m> llll has the form <b>[<m>parameter1</m> <m>content1</m>] [<m>parameter2</m> <m>content2</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>parameter</m> is some propriety of the custom notehead to be defined, followed by its value.
				The complete list of parameters symbols and their corresponding expected content is the following one: <br />
				– <b>fullname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation full name (e.g. "curly").<br />
				– <b>shortname</b>: a symbol defining the articulation short name (e.g. "cr").<br />
				– <b>alias</b>: up to 5 other names which will be mapped on the articulation when found in articulation slots.<br />
				– <b>font</b>: a symbol containing the font name, or "default" (in order to use the defined "notationfont").<br />
				– <b>basept</b>: the basic font size (corresponding to a no-vzoom situation).<br />
				– <b>char</b>: symbol or unicode value determining the notehead character. If two values are input, they refer respectively to the "black" and "white" flavours
				(assigned <o>bach.score</o> to black and white notes). If three values are input, they refer respectively to "black", "white" and "whole note" flavours.
				If four values are input they refer respectively to "black", "white", "whole note" and "double whole note". <br />
				<br />
				The following specifications will refer to unzoomed situations, and will be scaled according to the zoom: <br />
				– <b>xshift</b>: horizontal shift (positive values move right). <br />
				– <b>yshift</b>: vertical shift (positive values move up). <br />
				– <b>width</b>: the width of the notehead. <br />
				– <b>xshiftsmall</b>: same as xshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>yshiftsmall</b>: same as yshift, but for grace notes. <br />
				– <b>dlstartxshift</b>: horizontal offset for the beginning of the duration line. <br />
				<br />
				– <b>numparts</b>: specifies the information about the part assignment (see <m>numparts</m> attribute).
				– <b>loop</b>: specifies the information about the loop, as for the <m>loop</m> attribute, as a starting and ending point (in milliseconds, or as timepoints).
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any voice, in its simplest form <b>[<m>CHORD1</m> <m>CHORD1</m>... <m>voice_flag</m>]</b>
				where each <m>CHORD</m> is an llll representing a chord in gathered syntax, and the <m>voice_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if voice is locked), 2 (if voice is muted), 4 (if voice is solo). <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any chord, in its simplest form <b>[<m>onset_ms</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m>... <m>chord_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>onset_ms</m> is the onset of the chord (starting temporal point) in milliseconds each <m>NOTE</m>
				is an llll representing a note in gathered syntax, and the <m>chord_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of
				1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each chord can have a specification defining its name(s). This specification must be in the form
				<b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>, and must be put after the last note llll,
				before the <m>chord_flag</m>. For instance, a chord definition might
				have the form <b>[500 [7000. 500 127] [7200. 1200 100] [name paul] 0]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
				<br /> <br />
				The separate synax of a given parameter is nothing but an llll containing the value of such parameter for each notation item
				to which it can be applied. The llll should be properly structured depending on the hierarchical structure. <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, onsets are the only parameter assigned chordwise (they are a propriety of chords, rather than notes).
				The separate syntax for onsets will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing a value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[0 1000 2000 3000] [100 400] [250 2500]</b>. <br />
				Cents, durations, velocities and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.roll</o> (they are propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [[5500] [5400]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.roll</o> can properly understand
				<b>[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [5500 5400]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut.
				<br /> <br />
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Syntax: <b>merge <m>[&lt;sym: selection&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;float: threshold_ms&gt;</m> <m>&lt;float: threshold_cents&gt;</m> <m>[&lt;int: time_merging_policy&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;int: pitch_vel_merging_policy&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>merge 200 10</b>   <i>→ merge chords and markers &lt;= 200ms and notes &lt;= 10cents</i><br />
				• <b>merge -1 10</b>   <i>→ just merge notes &lt;= 10cents</i><br />
				• <b>merge 200 -1</b>   <i>→ just merge chords and markers &lt;= 200ms</i><br />
				• <b>merge selection 200 10</b>   <i>→ only merge elements if selected</i><br />
				• <b>sel chords, merge selection 200 -1</b>   <i>→ just merge chords &lt;= 200ms</i><br />
				• <b>merge 200 10 -1</b>   <i>→ align result to the leftmost merged chord</i><br />
				• <b>merge 200 10 1 -1</b>   <i>→ align result to the rightmost merged chord and bottommost pitch</i><br />
				<br />
				You can use the <m>merge</m> message to perform a merging of chords too near (with respect to the time),
				and/or of notes too near (with respect to the pitch). The two tasks are separate tasks: the first implies that chords
				lying within a given time threshold will be merged to a single chord; the second implies that notes whose pitches differ
				by less then a pitch threshold will be merged to a single note. <br />
				Two arguments are needed for the "merge" command: the time threshold (in milliseconds) and the pitch threshold (in cents).
				If any of the two threshold is set as negative, this means that there will be no corresponding merging: leave the time threshold as negative
				if you only want to merge in the pitch direction, leave the pitch threshold as negative if you only want to merge chords in the time coordinate. <br />
				Two additional optional arguments can be given specifying, respectively: the time merging policy (-1 = align to the leftmost chord,
				0 = align to the average of chords, 1 = align to the rightmost chord), the pitch/velocity merging policy (-1 = set pitch/velocity to the bottommost
				pitch/velocity, 0 = set pitch/velocity to the average of pitches/velocities, 1 = set pitch/velocity to the topmost pitch/velocity).
				The merging policies are optional parameters: if you don't specify them, by default they are 0 (= merge to the average). <br />
				If an optional "selection" symbol is put in front of the time threshold argument, the merging is performend only on the current selection,
				otherwise it is performed on the whole score. <br />
				Merging also applies to markers, which actually entails a deletion of markers nearer than <m>threshold_ms</m> to some other marker.
				Time position is averaged with <m>time_merging_policy</m> also. If you don't want markers to be thinned, consider selecting all chords only
				and then using <m>merge selection</m>.

				• <b>name George @append 1</b>   <i>→ add 'George' as name to selected elements</i><br />
				• <b>name [George Martin] [George Harrison]</b>   <i>→ assign complex llll name</i><br />
				• <b>name George @progeny 1</b>   <i>→ if chords are selected also assign name to their notes</i><br />

				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@incremental</m> (int, default: 0): If non-zero, assigns incremental numbering to selected markers in addition to names<br />
				<m>@progeny</m> (int, default: 0): If non-zero, assigns names to both selected chords and all their notes<br />
				<m>@append</m> (int, default: 0): If non-zero, appends name to existing ones<br />
				<br />
				The word <m>name</m>, followed by a symbol, a number or an llll, assigns such content as names for the
				selected notation items. <br />
				If markers are selected, an additional message attribute can be given in order to name them with an incremental naming system,
				keeping the first one of the introduced names, and then adding an integer as second name, so that the overall name is unique
				inside the <o>bach.roll</o>. The additional message attribute must be given in the form <b>@incremental 1</b>,
				to be appended at the end of the message. For instance <b>name foo @incremental 1</b> will name all selected elements as "foo",
				but will name all selected markers as "foo 1", "foo 2", and so on (unless one of such names was already taken, and thus it is skipped
				to guarantee the unicity). <br />
				If a <b>@progeny 1</b> attribute is added and chords are selected, not only the chord name is changed, but also the name of all its notes.
				This is handy for instance, if one needs to send <b>name @progeny 1</b> to delete all names of selected chords and notes.

				Examples:<br />
				• <b>onset 1000</b>   <i>→ move selected items to 1s</i><br />
				• <b>onset = 1000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />

				<br />
				The word <m>onset</m>, followed by a number, sets the new onset, in milliseconds, for all
				the selected notation items. This absolute onset can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the
				existing onset, or by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.

				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

				If the clipboard contains a portion of score, this score is pasted at its exact original position. Two optional arguments
				changes this behavior: the first argument is a floating point number setting the onset at which the copied portion should be pasted (use <b>[]</b>
				or <b>nil</b> to keep the original position, use the "end" symbol to paste at the end of the score,
				use the "replace" symbol to paste replacing current selection), the second argument is an integer
				setting the number of the uppermost voice for pasting (pasting will retain original voices if no second argument is set). <br />
				If the clipboard contains duration line (breakpoints) content, and the "durationline" symbol is used as first argument,
				the duration line is applied to all selected notes. <br />
				If the clipboard contains slot content, and the "slot" symbol is used as first argument,
				the slot content is applied to the selected notes. If an integer argument is given, and a single slot
				was copied, the slot content is applied only to the specified slot number. This number can be replaced with the "active" symbol, and the
				slot content will be applied to the open slot window. <br />
				Exactly analogously, a "slotinfo" symbol can be used instead of "slot", and if the clipboard contains slotinfo content, then

				• <b>pitch = pitch - C1</b>   <i>→ transpose one octave down</i><br />
				• <b>pitch = [pitch % C1] + C5</b>   <i>→ collapse to middle octave</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>pitch</m>, followed by a pitch, sets the new pitch, in midicents, for all
				the selected notation items. Differently from <m>cents</m>, the <m>pitch</m> message preserve diatonic information.
				If a list of pitches is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded. <br /> <br />
				Any of the numbers in the pitch syntax can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing pitch.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.

				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),

				Convert a pixel position into a time position
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>pixeltotime <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;float: pixel_position&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Example: <b>pixeltotime 300</b>   <i>→ get the time position corresponding to 300pixels</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>pixeltotime</m> message converts a position given in pixels into a position given in milliseconds, representing
				the time corresponding to the inserted pixel position.
				The output answer is sent through the playout, and its syntax is: <b>time <m>time_position_ms</m></b>, where the last element
				is indeed the time position (in milliseconds) corresponding to the inserted pixel position. <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a
				general form <b><m>query_router_symbol</m> <m>label_name</m> <m>QUERY_ANSWER</m></b>. Just to make an example,
				the answer of <b>pixeltotime [label john] 6000</b> might be something like <b>pixel john 300.</b>.
				It works accordingly for any other query.

				Syntax: <b>play <m>[&lt;symbol: scheduling_mode&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;float: start_ms&gt;]</m> <m>[&lt;float: end_ms&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>play</b>   <i>→ play from current playhead position</i><br />
				• <b>play 2000</b>   <i>→ play starting from 2s till the end</i><br />
				• <b>play 2000 4000</b>   <i>→ play starting from 2s, stop at 4s</i><br />
				• <b>play offline</b>   <i>→ play in non-realtime mode ("uzi-like")</i><br />
				• <b>play offline 2000 4000</b>   <i>→ play from 2s to 4s in non-realtime mode</i><br />
				• <b>play preschedule</b>   <i>→ accurate prescheduled playback (with limitations)</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>play</m> message plays a portion or all the <o>bach.roll</o>.
				"Playing" means that <o>bach.roll</o> sends from the "playout" outlet, at the timing corresponding to each chord onset,
				the information about all the chord, or about all the notes of the chord (depending on the <m>playmode</m> attribute, to which you
				should refer to know more). Markers are also sequenced if the <m>playmarkers</m> attribute is set to 1.
				The sequencing takes into account the solo and mute state of each element (see <m>solo</m>, <m>unsolo</m>, <m>mute</m> and <m>unmute</m> messages):
				if elements are muted, they will not be sequences; if some elements are set as "solo", just those elements will be sequenced.
				If multiple chords or notes are simultaneous, the order is from topmost voice to bottommost voice, then from lowest note to highest note.
				Sequencing can be controlled with a variable speed via the <m>clock</m> message and the <o>setclock</o> object.
				The <m>play</m> message, without any further argument, plays the <o>bach.roll</o> from the current playhead cursor position
				(by default: the beginning of the <o>bach.roll</o>) to the end. <br />
				If you put as first argument the "offline" symbol, all the playing will be done in non-real-time mode, i.e. with no sequencing involved; playing messages
				will be still output from the playout, but one after another, "immediately". <br />
				If you put as first argument the "preschedule" symbol, all the playing events will be prescheduled.
				Prescheduled playback schedules the events at the beginning of the playback, hence taking a bit more time before playback starts, but also ensuring
				ensures the best possible timing. Prescheduled playback has some limitations: <br />
				- no live modification to the roll or score is accounted for during playback; <br />
				- loops won't work;  <br />
				- lambda+modifications won't work;  <br />
				- redraw is only performed at each new event;  <br />
				- the "pause" message won't work.  <br />
				If you give a single numeric argument, it will be the starting point in milliseconds
				of the region to be played: <o>bach.roll</o> will play from that point to the end. If you give two numeric arguments, they will be the starting and
				ending point in milliseconds of the region to be played.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />

				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Only play selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>playselection <m>[&lt;symbol: scheduling_mode&gt;]</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>playselection</b>   <i>→ play selected items only</i><br />
				• <b>playselection offline</b>   <i>→ the same, in non-realtime mode ("uzi-like")</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>playselection</m> message only plays the selected content. It works exactly like <m>play</m>, but it starts playing
				at the beginning of the selection, and ends playing at the end of the last selected item. Only selected items are sequenced.
				Mute and solo status are also taken into account (see <m>play</m>). <br />
				If you put as first argument the "offset" symbol, all the playing will be done in non-real-time mode, i.e. with no sequencing involved; playing messages
				will be still output from the playout, but one after another, "immediately", in the low-priority queue. <br />
				If you put as first argument the "preschedule" symbol, all the playing events will be prescheduled.
				Prescheduled playback schedules the events at the beginning of the playback, hence taking a bit more time before playback starts, but also ensuring
				ensures the best possible timing. Prescheduled playback has some limitations: <br />
				- no live modification to the roll or score is accounted for during playback; <br />
				- loops won't work;  <br />
				- lambda+modifications won't work;  <br />
				- redraw is only performed at each new event;  <br />
				- the "pause" message won't work.  <br />

		<method name="poc">
			<arg name="pitch_or_cents" optional="0" type="number/pitch/llll/anything" />
			<digest>
				Modify the pitch or cents of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>poc <m>&lt;number/pitch/llll/anything: pitch_or_cents&gt;</m> </b><br />				<br />
				The word <m>poc</m> is an acronym for "pitch or cents", and will change either the pitch or the cents of the selected notes
				depending if the note has user-defined enharmonicities or not. If a note has user-defined enharmonicities, <m>poc</m> will
				essentially work like the <m>pitch</m> message; if not, it will work like the <m>cents</m> message (see both messages to know more). <br /> <br />
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

		<method name="poly">
			<arg name="maxnumvoices" optional="0" type="int" />

				Force maximum polyphony and/or assign voicing numbers for selection
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>poly <m>&lt;int: maxnumvoices&gt;</m> <i>[message attributes]</i> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>poly 1</b>   <i>→ make selection monophonic...</i><br />
				• <b>poly 1 @resume 1</b>   <i>→ ...and resume notes if needed</i><br />
				• <b>poly 0 @voicingslot 5</b>   <i>→ detect and write voice index in slot 5</i><br />
				• <b>poly 0 @reassign 1</b>   <i>→ reassign selection to independent monophonic voices</i><br />
				• <b>poly 1 @droppriority oldest</b>   <i>→ make selection monophonic, dropping oldest notes first</i><br />
				• <b>poly 4</b>   <i>→ make selection playable with at most 4 monophonic instruments</i><br />
				<br />
				Message attributes:<br />
				<m>@droppriority</m> (symbol, default: closest): Handle which notes should be terminated<br />
				<m>@voicingslot</m> (int, default: 0): Slot number where voice index will be stored<br />
				<m>@reassign</m> (int, default: 0): Reassign notes in detected voices<br />
				<m>@voicingslot</m> (int, default: 0): Slot number where voice index will be stored<br />
				<m>@notify</m> (int, default: 1): Notify maximum number of used voices through the playout<br />
				<m>@resume</m> (int, default: 0): Resume terminated notes if possible<br />
				<m>@resumepriority</m> (symbol, default: closest): Handle which notes should be resumed<br />
				<m>@resumevoicing</m> (int, default: 1): Only resume notes with their original voicing<br />
				<br />
				The <m>poly</m> message followed by a number <m>N</m> forces the selected material to be playable with at most <m>N</m> independent
				monophonic voices. For instance <m>poly 1</m> will force the selection to be monophonic, <m>poly 2</m> will force it to be playable with
				two voices, and so on. Use <m>N</m> = 0 in order to avoid forcing a maximum number of voices - and, possibly, instead using the other following features
				of the <m>poly</m> message. <br />
				During the process, each note is assigned its own voice index.
				If the <m>voicingslot</m> message attribute is set to 1, such index is also put inside such slot;
				if the <m>reassign</m> message attribute is set to 1, each voice is
				repositioned in the voice corresponding to its index. Hence, for instance, use <m>poly 0 @reassign 1</m> to reassign the selection to
				a certain number of (automatically created) independent monophonic voices.  <br />
				Unless the <m>notify</m> message attribute is unset, the maximum number of used voices (always less or equal to <m>N</m>, unless <m>N</m> is 0)
				is output through the playout preceded by the "maxpoly" symbol. <br />
				The <m>droppriority</m> message attribute decides which notes should be terminated whenever the maximum number of voices is reached;
				it can be one of the following symbols: "oldest" (drop oldest first), "newest" (drop newest first),
				"closest" (drop closest notes in pitch first, default), "loudest" (drop loudest first), "quietest" (drop quietest first), "longest" (drop longest first)
				"shortest" (drop shortest first). <br />
				If the <m>resume</m> message attribute is set to 1, notes can be resumed if they have been terminated. In this case, the <m>resumepriority</m>
				message sets the priority for resuming, as one of the same symbols: "oldest" (resume oldest), "newest" (resume newest first),
				"closest" (resume closest notes in pitch first, default). Unless the <m>resumevoicing</m> message attribute is explicitly set to 0,
				resuming can only happen for notes on the voicing they initially had (i.e. with the same voice index).

				• <b>quantize body @content quantize but keep no header elements</b><br />
				• <b>quantize body keys markers @content as previously, but also keep keys and markers</b><br />
				<br />
				The <m>quantize</m> message outputs all the content of <o>bach.roll</o> from the first outlet,
				in a form which is understandable by <o>bach.quantize</o>.
				You should just connect the first outlet of <o>bach.roll</o> to the second inlet of <o>bach.quantize</o>, to have this latter
				properly get all the information (refer to the <o>bach.quantize</o> help and documentation; also see #quantize in the help center). <br />
				By default, the <m>quantize</m> message also outputs all the header information, but as for the <m>dump</m> message,
				if one needs to only dump specific header elements, the <m>quantize</m> message may also accept a list of symbols referring to them.
				Namely, the possibilities are the following ones: "keys", "clefs", "voicenames", "midichannels", "markers", "slotinfo", "command", "groups".
				Also the "body" symbol should always be added, in order to also dump the music content (otherwise no real quantization can be performed).
				For instance, <b>quantize keys slotinfo body</b> will dump the key signatures, the slotinfo and will send the quantization data of the
				music content.

				<m>@spiralh</m> (double, default: 3.8729): For Chew and Chen algorithm, sets the pitch spiral vertical step<br />
				<m>@numsliding</m> (int, default: 8): For Chew and Chen algorithm, sets the number of sliding windows<br />
				<m>@numselfreferential</m> (int, default: 2): For Chew and Chen algorithm, sets the number of selfreferential windows<br />
				<m>@discardalteredrepetitions</m> (int, default: 1): For Atonal algorithm, try to avoid repetitions of the same diatonic step with different alterations<br />
				<m>@stdevthresh</m> (llll/symbol, default: 21/(numnotes+1)): For Atonal algorithm, sets the equation for the threshold of the standard deviation of positions on the line of fifth<br />
				<m>@ignorelocked</m> (int, default: 1): If non-zero, locked notes are left unchanged (default)<br />
				<br />
				The <m>respell</m> message reset the enharmonicity ("graphics") specification of each selected note to a default one.
				Three algorithms are available, which can be set using the "algorithm" message attribute: a default algorithm,
				the algorithm provided by Chew and Chen, and an algorithm targeting atonal diatonic behaviors. The three algorithms
				are described below. For the two non-trivial algorithms some additional attributes may fine tune respelling properties: <br />
				• "selection" (int, default 0): toggles the ability to operate on selection only (also works for default algorithm); <br />
				• "voicewise" (int, default 1): toggles the ability to respell one voice at a time; <br />
				• "sharpest" (symbol/pitch, default: B#): sets the "sharpest" note available (the farthest right on the line of fifths); <br />
				• "flattest" (symbol/pitch, default: Fb): sets the "flattest" note available (the farthest left on the line of fifths); <br />
				• "verbose" (int, default: 0): toggle a verbose mode (mostly for debug). <br />
				The algorithms characteristics are the following ones:
				- Default algorithm ("default"): just respell the notes according to the current key and enharmonicity tables. <br />
				- Chew and Chen algorithm ("chewandchen"): implements the algorithm provided by Chew and Chen in the article
				"Determining Context-Defining Windows: Pitch Spelling using the Spiral Array". Additional parameters, defined via message attributes,
				are: <br />
				• "winsize" (double, default: 500): window size in milliseconds; <br />
				• "spiralr" (double, default: sqrt(2)): spiral radius; <br />
				• "spiralh" (double, default: sqrt(15)): spiral vertical step (i.e. the distance parallel to the axis of the helix corresponding
				to one step along the spiral array; <br />
				• "numsliding" (int, default: 8): number of sliding windows; <br />
				• "numselfreferential" (int, default: 2): number of self referential windows (see article); <br />
				• "locality" (double, default: 0.5): a value of 1 only takes self-referential window into account, a value of 0 only takes global context
				into account; any number in between will result in a linear combination of the two (this is the parameter <m>f</m> of the Chew and Chen article); <br />
				- Atonal algorithm ("atonal"): respell the notes in a tree-like fashion (closest ones first), optimizing their position on the line of fifths. <br />
				• "discardalteredrepetitions" (int, default: 1): discard solutions having subsequent repetitions of the same diatonic
				step with different alterations (e.g. F#4 F4, or Bb5 B5); <br />
				• "stdevthresh" (llll/symbol, default: 21/(numnotes+1)): sets a formula for a maximum standard deviation that the group of notes
				being retranscribed must have (interpreted as their projection onto the line of fifths); <br />

				<br />
				The word <m>sel</m> add some notation items to the current selection. In the basic behavior,
				the word must be followed by four elements, specifying: <br />
				- the starting temporal point of the selection, in milliseconds (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to select from the beginning); <br />
				- the ending temporal point of the selection, in milliseconds (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to select until the end); <br />
				- the minimum pitch of the selection, in cents (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you don't want to put a lower bound on pitches); <br />
				- the maximum pitch of the selection, in cents (leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you don't want to put an upper bound on pitches). <br />
				Other selection modes are possible: <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>all</b>, all notes, chords and markers are selected. <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by a category plural symbol, all the corresponding elements are selected.
				Category plural symbols are: <b>markers</b>, <b>notes</b>, <b>chords</b>, <b>breakpoints</b>, <b>tails</b>. <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>markers</b>, all markers are selected. <br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>chord</b> followed by one or two integers (representing an address), a certain chord is selected.
				The full syntax for the integers is: <m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>. If just an element is given, the voice number is considered
				to be by default 1. The chord index is the index of chords, sorted by onset.
				For instance, <b>sel chord 2</b> selects the second chord [of first voice], while <b>sel chord 3 2</b> does the same with the third voice.
				Negative positions are also allowed, counting backwards. Multiple chords can be selected at once, provided that instead of a list integers one gives
				a sequence of wrapped lists of integers, for instance <b>sel chord [1 1] [1 2] [1 3] [2 1] [3 -1]</b>.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbol <b>note</b> followed by one, two or three integers (representing an address), a certain note is selected.
				The full syntax for the integers is: <m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>. If less elements are given, the first ones are considered
				to be by default 1's. The chord index is the index of chords, sorted by onset; the note index is taken from the lowest to the highest.
				For instance, <b>sel note 2 3</b> selects the third note of second chord [of first voice], while <b>sel note 4 2 3</b> does the same with the fourth voice.
				Negative positions are also allowed, counting backwards. Multiple notes can be selected at once, provided that instead of a list integers one gives
				a sequence of wrapped lists of integers, for instance <b>sel note [5 2 4] [1 1 -1]</b>.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by the symbols <b>note if</b>, <b>rest if</b>, <b>marker if</b>, <b>breakpoint if</b>
				or <b>tail if</b> followed by a
				condition to be verified, a conditional selection on notes,  markers or pitch breakpoints (respectively) is performed.
				and notes/markers/pitch breakpoints matching such condition are selected.
				The condition must be an expr-like expression returning 1 if notes have to be selected, 0 otherwise.
				You can use symbolic variables inside such expressions. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance <b>sel note if velocity == 100</b> selects all notes whose
				velocity is exactly equal to 100, while <b>round[cents / 100.] % 12 == 0</b> select all the C's.<br />
				- If the word <m>sel</m> is followed by any other symbol or sequence of symbols, these are interpreted as names, and the notation items
				matching all these names (or a single name, if just one symbol is entered) are selected. <br />

				Syntax: <b>select <m>&lt;llll: arguments&gt;</m> </b><br />				<br />

				Send a command to selected items

			<description>
				Syntax: <b>sendcommand <m>&lt;int: command_number&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Example: <b>sendcommand 3</b>   <i>→ send 3rd command</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>sendcommand</m> message sends a given command to the selected notation items,
				whose content is then immediately output from the playout in playout syntax (see <m>dumpselection</m>)
				but with a router different from the standard playout syntax router, i.e. the router defined by the given command.
				It expects as argument the number of the command to be sent (1 to 5).
				You can safely rely on the fact that elements will be output ordered by onset.
				Commands are a mechanism to output selected content with given labels.
				You can define up to 5 user commands which will send user-defined messages upon a note or chord evaluation.
				The idea is that you can map each command to a hotkey: if one triggers the hot key (when something is selected),
				this will cause the output of the notes/chord content from the playouts, exactly as if such notes/chords were played.
				The only difference with the simple play situation, is that the router of those messages is not the "note" or "chord" symbol,
				but rather the custom symbol defined at the command declaration. This allows you to properly detect and route the message.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				<br />
				The <m>subroll</m> message outputs the gathered syntax information of a portion of the <o>bach.roll</o>,
				namely it outputs only certain voices and within a certain time interval.
				The syntax for the <m>subroll</m> message is:
				<b>subroll <m>VOICES</m> <m>TIME_LAPSE</m> <m>optional:SELECTIVE_OPTIONS</m></b>,
				<m>VOICES</m> is an llll of the kind <b>[<m>voice_number1</m> <m>voice_number2</m>...]</b>
				containing the number of the voices to be output; leave <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want to output all voices. <br />
				<m>TIME_LAPSE</m> is an llll of the kind <b>[<m>start_ms</m> <m>end_ms</m>]</b> containing the time lapse that
				has to be output. Leave such list as <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> if you want this lapse to be all the length of the <o>bach.roll</o>.
				Otherwise <m>start_ms</m> is the beginning of the portion of <o>bach.roll</o> to be output (in milliseconds), and

		<method name="tail">
			<arg name="tail_position_ms" optional="0" type="number/llll/anything" />
			<digest>
				Modify the tail position of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>tail <m>&lt;number/llll/anything: tail_position_ms&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>tail 1000</b>   <i>→ set selected items' tail at 1s</i><br />
				• <b>tail = 1000</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>tail = tail + 1000</b>   <i>→ lengthen selected notes by 1s</i><br />
				• <b>tail = 30000</b>   <i>→ make selection end together at 30s</i><br />
				• <b>tail = "onset + random[0, 1000]"</b>   <i>→ assign duration randomly</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>tail</m>, followed by a number, sets the new position of the tail, in milliseconds, for all
				the selected notation items. Such position must fall, for every chord, after the chord onset, otherwise it is clipped to the chord onset
				(no chords with negative durations are allowed).
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded.
				Any of the numbers can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing tail position.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

			<arg name="position_ms" optional="0" type="float" />
			<digest>
				Convert a time position into a pixel position
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>timetopixel <m>[&lt;llll: query_label&gt;]</m> <m>&lt;float: position_ms&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Example: <b>timetopixel 4000</b>   <i>→ get the pixel position corresponding to 4s</i><br />
				<br />
				The <m>timetopixel</m> message converts a position given in milliseconds (as argument) into a position given in pixels, representing
				the pixel at which such time position happens, in the current domain.
				The output answer is sent through the playout, and its syntax is: <b>pixel <m>pixel_position</m></b>, where the last element
				is indeed the position in pixels corresponding to the inserted position in milliseconds. <br />
				Moreover, each query can have in bach as very first argument a label, kept inside the query answer,
				which can be useful to retrieve queries separately (for instance to keep track of queries coming from different threads).
				To assign a label to a query, you have to put as very first argument after the query message (before any other query argument) an llll in the form
				<b>[label <m>label_name</m>]</b>, where <m>label_name</m> is a symbol you want to assign to the label.
				When the answer of a labelled query is output from the playout, after the first router symbol, the label will appear, thus yielding a

				<m>@mapping</m> (llll): Custom dynamics-to-velocity mapping via <b>[<m>dynamics</m> <m>velocity</m>]</b> pairs<br />
				<m>@unnecessary</m> (int, default: 1): If non-zero, drops unnecessary dynamic markings<br />
				<m>@thresh</m> (float, default: 1.): Hairpin detection threshold<br />
				<br />
				A <m>velocities2dynamics</m> message will infer and assign chord dynamics and hairpins, depending on the current velocities,
				for the whole score or - if "selection" is set as first argument, for the selected items only.
				The dynamics sequence considered is the one contained in the slot
				linked to dynamics, if any (see <m>linkdynamicstoslot</m>), or in another slot, if given as integer argument. <br />
				Unless explicit dynamic-velocity mapping is defined, a default mapping is used. Two message attributes handle such default mapping: <br />
				• the "maxchars" attribute sets the width of the dynamics spectrum; <br />
				• the "exp" attribute sets the exponent for the conversion. <br />
				The dynamics spectrum is the sequence of standard dynamics in the piano-to-forte range.
				It is characterized by its "maxchars", i.e. the maximum number of p's and f's of the elements it contains ("mp" and "mf"
				are considered as having 0 p's and f's).
				For instance, the collection of
				{"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"} makes for a spectrum of <m>maxchars</m> = 2.
				The "maxchars" property of the dynamic spectrum will factor into different conversions between dynamics and velocities,
				in combination with a conversion exponent.
				The dynamic range is set via the "maxchars" parameter, while the exponent is set via the "exp" parameter (greater than 0. and less or equal to 1.).
				If "exp" is 1., the velocity range is divided linearly between the dynamics in the spectrum; otherwise an exponential scaling is applied.
				Default exponent is 0.8, and default range width is 5 (from "pppp" to "ffff").
				Any dynamic marking outside the spectrum will be clipped to the spectrum during conversion.
				The dynamics are scaled so that "mp" will always correspond to velocity = 64.
				If i is the index of the
				If <m>i</m> is the 1-based index of the element of a spectrum containing 2D elements <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(-1+2i/(2D+1))*|-1+2i/(2D+1)|^a)/2)^b <br />
				More clearly, once set x = x(i, D) = -1+2i/(2D+1), between -1 and 1, one has <br />
				vel(i) = 128 * ((1 + sgn(x)*|x|^a)/2)^b. <br />
				This function assumes values between 0. and 1., for x in [-1, 1].
				In any case vel(i) is clipped to 127 (128 won't be allowed).
				The parameter <m>a</m> is the "exp" parameter defined above. The parameter <m>b</m> is chosen so that vel("mp") = vel(D) = 64, which yields <br />
				b = 1/(1 - log2(1 - 1/((2D+1)^a))) <br />
				As an example, if "exp" (i.e. <m>a</m>) is 0.8 (hence <m>b</m> is about 0.745),
				consider the spectrum {"pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 2 and <m>D</m> = 3 (containing <m>2D</m> = 6 elements).
				The dynamics "f" has index 5, hence x = x(5, 3) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 10/7 = 3/7, hence <br />
				vel("f") = vel(5) = 128 * ((1 + (3/7)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.810 ~ 103, <br />
				while within the broader spectrum {"pppp", "ppp", "pp", "p", "mp", "mf", "f", "ff", "fff", "ffff"}, having <m>maxchars</m> = 4 and <m>D</m> = 5,
				one has x = x(7, 5) = -1+2i/(2D+1) = -1 + 14/11 = 3/11
				vel("f") = vel(7) = 128 * ((1 + (3/11)^a)/2)^b ~ 128 * 0.748 ~ 96. <br />
				Moreover, the "mapping" attribute defines a non-standard or more general mapping via an llll specification. Such parameter has syntax
				<b>[mapping [<m>dynamics1</m> <m>velocity1</m>] [<m>dynamics2</m> <m>velocity2</m>]...]</b>.
				Differently from <m>dynamics2velocities</m>, if you define a mapping, you need to define the velocity association for each of the dynamic marking
				you want to use. <br />
				An "unnecessary" attribute toggles whether unnecessary dynamic markings should by default be dropped (default is 1: yes, use 0 to turn this of). <br />
				Finally, a "thresh" attribute sets a threshold for hairpin detection (default is 1., 0. meaning: no hairpin detection).

				Modify the velocity of selected items
			</digest>
			<description>
				Syntax: <b>velocity <m>&lt;int/llll/anything: velocity&gt;</m> </b><br />
				Examples:<br />
				• <b>velocity 120</b>   <i>→ set selected items' velocity to 120</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = 120</b>   <i>→ exactly the same</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = velocity * 1.2</b>   <i>→ increase velocity</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = duration/1000.</b>   <i>→ assign velocity depending on duration</i><br />
				• <b>velocity = "random[40, 121]"</b>   <i>→ assign velocity randomly</i><br />
				<br />
				The word <m>velocity</m>, followed by a number, sets the new velocity (from 1 to 127) for all
				the selected notation items.
				If a list of numbers is given as arguments, this is applied to selected chords notewise: bottommost note will be assigned
				the first value, the one above will be assigned the next one, and so on. If less values than selected notes in the chord
				are given, last value is padded.
				Any of the numbers can be replaced by an llll containing a relative modification of the existing velocity.
				If a single number is inserted, this can be replaced by a generic equation.
				All parameters, except for <o>bach.score</o>'s timepoints, also support a relative modification syntax, which modifies the existing values instead
				Relative modifications of a parameter are handled via lllls of the type <b>[<m>value</m> <m>function</m>]</b>, where
				the <m>function</m> is one of the following symbols: "plus", "minus", "times", "div". Such modification applies the corresponding
				function to the current value of the parameter and the inserted <m>value</m>. For instance, <b>[100 minus]</b> removes 100 to the current
				value of the parameter, while <b>[2. times]</b> multiplies it by two.
				<br /> <br />
				All separate parameters, except for measureinfo, ties and slots, can also be modified via a generic equation. In order to do so,
				the message symbol must be followed by an <m>=</m> sign (with spaces before and after it), and then by the desired equation.
				The standard symbolic variables are available. <br />
				Symbolic variables are variables that can be used in the conditional selection or parameter modification processes.
				These are: <m>onset</m> (in ms), <m>duration</m> (in ms), <m>velocity</m>, <m>cents</m> (pitch in MIDIcents), <m>pitch</m> (diatonic pitch),
				<m>tail</m> (position of the note end, in ms), <m>voice</m> (voice number), <m>part</m> (part number), <m>voiceensemble</m> (voiceensemble number).
				For <o>bach.score</o> you can also use: <m>symduration</m> (symbolic rational duration),
				<m>symonset</m> (symbolic rational onset inside the measure), <m>symtail</m> (sum of the two previous), <m>measure</m> (the measure number),
				<m>tie</m> (which is 1 if a tie starts, 2 if a tie ends and 3 if a tie both starts and ends, 0 otherwise) and <m>grace</m> (1 for
				grace chords, 0 otherwise). <br />
				In addition, you also have the <m>index</m> symbol, corresponding to the index of the item: the index of the note in the chord (bottom-up),
				the index of the chord in the measure or voice (left to right), the index of the measures, voices, markers, pitch breakpoints, etc.
				(all left to right). In case you need to distinguish between chord index and note index, for a given note, you can explicitly use the
				<m>chordindex</m> or <m>noteindex</m> symbols. <br />
				For instance, one could define <b>velocity = duration / 100. + onset * 0.01</b> or <b>cents = cents + 200</b>, or
				<b>onset = [cents - 6000] / 100 + 2000 * [voice - 1]</b>.
				The equation syntax extends in a sense the relative modification syntax; however it is applied to the globality of the selection, and
				one cannot apply different equations to different notes inside the chord.

			<description>
				Sets the way of displaying accidentals: <br />
				- None: no accidental is displayed. <br />
				- Classical: accidentals are displayed with the classical symbols (sharps, flats...).
				This option is only available if <m>tonedivision</m> is 2, 4 or 8. <br />
				- Fraction: accidentals are displayed as fractions of tone (e.g. "-1/4" for quartertone flat or "+1/2" for
				an ordinary sharp). <br />
				- Unreduced Fraction: as the previous one, but fractions are never reduced. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is
				48 one would have "+2/8" and not "+1/4". Denominator of each fraction is the <m>tonedivision</m>
				(thus a tonedivision 2 has denominators 2, as expected for standard sharps and flats). <br />
				- Cents: accidentals are displayed as cents differences with respect to the diatonic note.
				Remark that, unless <m>tonedivision</m> is 100, the displayed cents difference will not in general correspond to the
				real cents difference: the first one will be indeed a cents difference snapped to the chosen microtonal grid.
				For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 8, a note having midicents 6027 will be displayed as a middle C with a "+25cents" accidental.

				- Sharps: always choose sharp accidentals (more precisely, in general: always
				choose a representation such that the displayed diatonic pitch is below the actual note). <br />
				- Flats: always choose flat accidentals (more precisely, in general: always
				choose a representation such that the displayed diatonic pitch is above the actual note). <br />
				- Custom: use a custom enharmonic table, defined via the <m>enharmonictable</m> attribute.

				instant will have their stems vertically aligned. <br />
				- Notehead Center (default): means that chords are aligned by the center of the main notehead. This is similar to what happens in <o>bach.score</o>:
				two chords falling on the same time instant, one with stem up and one with stem down, will be aligned according to the position of their noteheads, and not
				the position of their stems. The noteheads will result aligned. <br />
				- Notehead End: chords are aligned by the ending point of their noteheads. In this case, the duration line perfectly spans the time duration of the notes.

				The full November font covers a wide range of music symbols, from Renaissance to the XXI century, and gives a unique,
				warm and lively look to your music scores. It is fully compatible with Finale, Sibelius and other notation softwares.
				You can purchase November from this web address: www.klemm-music.de/notation/november/.
				Other supported fonts are: Boulez, Maestro, Petrucci, Engraver Font Set. Not all articulations are supported by all fonts.
				You can however always define custom articulations with any font of your choice.

				Clefs
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the clefs. A list of symbols is expected, the length of the list will also automatically change the <m>numvoices</m> attribute
				and update the number of voices.
				Each clef symbol can be one of the following: "G", "F", "FG", "FGG", "FFG", "FFGG", "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb",
				"Soprano", "Mezzo", "Alto", "Tenor", "Soprano", "Mezzo", "Tenor", "Alto", "Barytone", "Percussion", "None". <br />
				Clefs such as "FGG" correspond to multiple-staff voices: for instance, in this case, we have a standard piano staff ("FG") with an additional
				G clef superposed (transposed a 15ma above). The "G8va", "G15ma", "G8vb", "G15mb", "F8va", "F15ma", "F8vb", "F15mb" symbols correspond to
				octave-transposed clefs. For instance, "G8va" is the G clef, transposed one octave above, whereas "F15mb" is the F clef transposed two octaves below.
				<br /> <br />
				A special message <b>clefs auto</b> will detect automatically the most appropriate clefs to display
				the musical content, and will set them: such message will apply to all the existing voices, and will not change the number of voices.
				You can use the "auto" symbol instead of any symbol in order to have bach detect automatically the most appropriate clefs
				for the given voice, depending on its notes (e.g. <b>clefs auto G FG</b>). However, in this case the message will also change the
				<m>numvoices</m> attribute, as for the standard case. You can restrict the clef to be automatically chosen among a set of clefs by wrapping
				them between parentheses, preceded by the "auto" symbol. For instance, <b>clefs G F [auto F G] auto</b> will choose the 3rd clef only between
				F and G, while the fourth clef is chosen among a standard set of predefined clefs.

				Absolute: pixels are considered inside the object box (0 being the leftmost line of the object box).
				This solution will not automatically account for the scrollbar; this is especially handy if the spacing
				needs to be retrieved from another notation object, such as a <o>bach.score</o>. <br />
				Relative: pixels are considered from the standard 0 position onwards, and the user is not asked
				to account for the scrollbar. <br />

				Custom Enharmonic Table
			</digest>
			<description>
				An enharmonic table is a string of elements defining the accidentals to be used for each step of the chromatic scale.
				A symbol for each voice (containing such string of characters) is expected. If less symbols than the number of voices
				are defined, the last one is padded.
				The number of elements in the string depends on the <m>tonedivision</m>; more precisely it is the <m>tonedivision</m> multiplied by 6.
				Standard case is <m>tonedivision</m> = 2, and thus the full 12 steps must be defined.
				Elements are sequencies of characters associated to accidentals.
				For instance "bb" is associated to a double flat, while "#+" is associated to a three quarter tones sharp.
				Such elements are to be separated by white spaces. For instance, if <m>tonedivision</m> is 12, a string like
				<b>enharmonictable "n # n b n n b n b n b x"</b> says that the C must be represented as natural, the note above will
				be a C# (and not a Db), the one above a D natural, the one above a Eb (and not a D#), and so on. Last note says that
				the B will actually be a Ax (A double diesis). <br />
				In the bach environment, accidentals can be written or output as ascii using the following symbols: <br />
				# for stanard 1/2 tone sharp <br />
				b for stanard 1/2 tone flat <br />
				x for stanard tone sharp <br />
				bb for stanard tone flat <br />
				+ for 1/4 tone sharp; <br />
				d or - for 1/4 tone flat; <br />
				#+ for 3/4 tone sharp; <br />
				db for 3/4 tone flat; <br />
				^ for 1/8 tone up; <br />
				v for 1/8 tone down. <br />
				Of course, these symbols can be combined, like in #+^ or dv.
				The 1/8 symbols are used also for smaller intervals (at output time).
				<br /> <br />

				Keys
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the key signatures. A list of symbols is expected, one symbol for each voice.
				If less symbols are entered, the last one is padded.
				The syntax for the single key signature must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>optional:mode</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Note names are allowed both in anglo-saxon (C, D, E...) and in latin (Do, Re, Mi) format. In both ways,
				they are case insensitive ("c" or "C", "do" or "DO" is the same). <br /> <br />
				Accidentals are defined as string of ASCII characters, each identifying one accidental.
				The list of allowed characters is the following one: <br />
				"n" = natural <br />
				"#" = sharp (+1/2 tone) <br />
				"x" = double sharp (+ 1 tone) <br />
				"+" = monesis = quarter sharp (+1/4 tone) <br />
				"^" = +1/8 tone <br />
				"b" = flat (-1/2 tone) <br />
				"d" or "-" = mobemol = quarter flat (-1/4 tone) <br />
				"v" = -1/8 tone <br />
				If no accidental is defined, the natural is used by default.
				<br /> <br />
				The mode can be either "M" (major) or "m" minor. If no mode is defined, the major is used by default.

			<description>
				Chooses the way in which elements bearing the same names should be visually tagged: <br />

				- Singleton: enclose each single notation item in a shape (circle for notes, rectangles for chords and measures)
				bearing the same color for each family. <br />
				- Bounding Box: enclose all items of a certain family in a rectangle bounding box. IMPORTANT: in this case,
				you might end up with having other notes (not belonging to that family) inside the bounding box. <br />
				- Venn: enclose families in an unique closed curve. This will usually work well if points are not too much scattered among other points.
				Notice that in this case, points not belonging to the label family lie outside the curve. BEW

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

				Constraint Pitches While Editing
			</digest>
			<description>
				Force edited pitches to lie in a given range, given by the specified llll.
				One sublist for each voice is expected. For any given voice, the sublist must be in one of the following forms: <br />
				- a plain llll specifies a list of allowed midicents, e.g. <b>[6000 6200 6400 6500 6700 6900 7100 7200]</b> will
				force edited notes to lie in the C major scale in middle octave; <br/>
				- a two-elements wrapped llll specifies a range of allowed midicents, e.g. <b>[[6000 7200]]</b> will do the same as above, but will also
				allow notes in principle to have any microtonal value such as 6050;<br/>
				- you can combine the two syntaxes to have the general one. For instance <b>[3600 4800 [6000 7200] 8400 9600]]</b> will
				force pitches to be in one of the specified C's or in the middle octave.<br/>
				Such list must be given for any voice. Use a <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> list to allow all possibilities for a voice.
				For instance: <b>pitchededitrange [7100] [[6000 7200]] []</b> will force first voice's edited notes to snap to 7100 mc (and no other note can be inserted or edited!),
				second voice's edited notes to lie in middle octave, and third voice's edited notes to assume any available pitch. <br />
				Note names (in latin or anglo-saxon syntax) can always be used instead of midicents.

				Playout Mode
			</digest>
			<description>
				Sets the syntax of the content output from the playout: either a chordwise playout syntax,
				or a notewise playout syntax (default). <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Full Path In Playout Syntax
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggle the ability to output from the playout, instead of the voice number, the full path
				to get to the played element.
				The playout syntax normally has as first element the voice number of the output item (note or chord).
				By default this attribute is 0, and the simple voice number is output as first element. <br />
				If this flag is active, for <o>bach.roll</o>, the voice number is substituted with the list
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is chord-wise, or
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is note-wise.
				The <m>chord_index</m> is the index of the chord, when ordered by onsets. The <m>note_index</m> is the
				index of the note (from the lowest to highest one).
				For instance, instead of <b>note 1 1 [...]</b> one might have <b>note [1 4 2] 1 [...]</b>, meaning that
				the output information concerns the 2nd note of 4th chord of 1st voice.
				Voice is anyway always the first element in the output llll. <br />
				If this flag is active, for <o>bach.score</o>, the voice number is substituted with a list of lists, namely
				<b>[<m>LIST1</m> <m>LIST2</m>...]</b>. The slightly complex form is due to the fact that
				tied notes or chords are output just once for all from the playout, so that each output element
				may be a combination of subsequently tied notes or chords. Each one of the <m>LIST</m>s represents one of these elements,
				and has the form
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is chord-wise, or
				<b>[<m>voice_number</m> <m>measure_number</m> <m>chord_index</m> <m>note_index</m>]</b>, if the <m>playmode</m> is note-wise.
				The <m>chord_index</m> is the index of the chord inside the measure. The <m>note_index</m> is the
				index of the note (from the lowest to highest one).
				For instance, instead of <b>note 1 1 [...]</b> one might have <b>note [[1 3 4 2] [1 4 1 3]] 1 [...]</b>,
				meaning that the output information concerns two notes: the 2nd note of 4th chord of 3rd measure of 1st voice,
				which is tied to the 3rd note of 1st chord of 4th measure of 1st voice.
				Voice is anyway always the first element in the output llll. <br />

				Play Partial Notes
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggle the ability to play partial notes, when the playhead starts from a point where a note has
				already started but not yet ended. In this case, all temporal information (temporal slots, pitch breakpoints)
				is properly trimmed, and the corresponding partial note is played.
				By default this is 1 (quiet playing); if you set the attribute to 2 (verbosely), instead of the onset a
				llll in the form <b>[partial <m>original_onset</m> <m>played_onset</m> <m>offset</m>]</b> is output.

				Play Rests
			</digest>
			<description>
				Toggles the ability to also play rests, having <b>rest</b> as symbol router for the playout llll.
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.

				Prevent Editing For
			</digest>
			<description>
				Prevents the interface editing of the specified elements, specified via an llll. Somehow, this is a lock specified globally for given notation items or features.
				If the first symbol is a "-" (minus), the editing is prevented for any element or feature, except for the specified ones. <br />
				The llll must contain at its root level: <br />
				- either single symbols, with the items or features names to be completely "locked", e.g. <b>preventedit measure lyrics inspector</b> will prevent the editing of all measures
				(one cannot create, delete, modify them), lyrics, and will not allow the opening of the bach inspector; <br />
				- or lllls in the form <b>[<m>item_or_feature_name</m> <m>property1</m> <m>property2</m> <m>property3</m>...]</b>, where properties are symbols which restrict the locking
				only to a given aspect of the item or feature. For instance, <b>preventedit [measure create delete] [marker onset]</b> will prevent the creation and deletion of measures
				(but not their modification!), and will also prevent the movement of existing markers (but not the creation of new ones!). <br/>
				The two approaches. <br />
				Here is the complete list of symbols which can be used to define items and feature names; parentheses list symbols for the single properties which one can block for them: <br />
				notes (create, delete, onset, duration, pitch, velocity, modify), measures (create, delete, rhythmictree, modify), voice (create, delete, name, clef, key, position, modify),
				breakpoints (create, delete, onset, pitch, velocity, modify), tempi (create, delete, modify), slots, markers (create, delete, onset, name, modify), articulations (create, delete),
				selection, zooming, dilationrectangle, groups, inspector, popup, slotinfo, lyrics, cursor, loop, scrollbar, drop. <br />
				The "modify" symbol only refers to modification different from the previously defined ones. For instance: <b>preventedit [breakpoints modify]</b> will not
				prevent the modification of breakpoints onsets, but will, as an example, prevent the modification of breakpoints slopes. Use <b>preventedit [breakpoints onset modify]</b> to do both.

				Display Accidentals
			</digest>
			<description>
				Handles the display of accidentals: <br />
				- Classically (default): for <o>bach.score</o>: accidentals are displayed classically, i.e. on the first (altered) note requiring them,
				and them never for any other note inside the same measure (but cautionary accidentals are possible: see the attribute <m>cautionaryaccidentals</m>);
				for <o>bach.roll</o>: this coincides with Altered Note (No Naturals) (see below). <br />
				- Always: accidentals are always displayed for all altered and naturals notes. <br />
				- Altered Notes: accidentals are always displayed for any altered note. Natural signs are preserved for notes which have to cancel such accidental. <br />
				- Altered Notes (No Repetition): accidentals are always displayed for any altered note, but dropped for immediate repetitions of the same note. <br />
				- Altered Note (No Naturals): accidentals are always displayed for any altered note, and natural signs are dropped for notes having to cancel such accidentals.
				In this case all non-natural notes have their accidental, and all natural notes have no accidental. <br />
				- Never: accidentals are never shown (always hidden). <br />
				IMPORTANT: be aware of the fact that, due to the cross dependencies between accidentals, in <o>bach.roll</o> the "Altered Notes"
				"Altered Notes (No Repetition)" configurations can be sensibly slower than any other any other configuration
				(<o>bach.score</o>, on the other hand, does not suffer from this issue).

				Sets the staff lines. An llll containing as many elements as the number of voices is expected,

				Each staff line element (for the given voice) can be either an integer number,

				located around the middle line of a standard 5-lines-staff), or an llll, containing the explicit

				the standard 5-lines-staff, 5 to the topmost one, and all other numbers work accordingly.
				Zero or negative indices are also allowed. For instance, <b>[0 5 6]</b> will set as stafflines the one below
				the bottommost default one, the topmost line of a default staff, and the one above.
				Use <b>0</b> or <b>nil</b> or <b>[]</b> to hide all the stafflines of a staff.

			<description>
				In the bach environment, the tone division defines the microtonal accuracy of the symbolic representation,

				For the standard semitonal representation (where just sharps and flats suffice), one can stick with
				<m>tonedivision</m> being 2, meaning: the tone is divided into two semitones.
				By increasing this value, the microtonal grid gets more dense: for instance, 4 is the quartertonal grid
				(where each tone is divided in 4 quartertones); 8 is the eight-tonal grid, and so on.

				In <o>bach.roll</o>, onsets are the only parameter assigned chordwise (they are a propriety of chords, rather than notes).
				The separate syntax for onsets will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing a value for each chord.
				For instance: <b>[0 1000 2000 3000] [100 400] [250 2500]</b>. <br />
				Cents, durations, velocities and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.roll</o> (they are propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,

				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.roll</o> can properly understand
				<b>[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [5500 5400]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as

				For instance: <b>[0 1000 2000 3000] [100 400] [250 2500]</b>. <br />
				Cents, durations, velocities and extras are all assigned notewise in <o>bach.roll</o> (they are propriety of notes, rather than chords).
				The separate syntax for any of such parameters will be thus structured as: an llll for each voice, containing an llll for each chord,
				containing a value for each note. For instance, a cents assignment can have the following form:
				<b>[[6000] [6000 6400] [6200] [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [[5500] [5400]]</b>. <br />
				While using separate syntax as input, for all notewise parameter, except for extras, a shortcut is tolerated: one can assign a
				single value for each chord (and not each note) meaning that such value must be applied to the whole chord. If no chord exists,
				and such value must create a chord, then a chord with a single note si created. For instance, <o>bach.roll</o> can properly understand
				<b>[6000 [6000 6400] 6200 [6200 6500]] [[7200] [6500 7200 7500]] [5500 5400]</b>. However, when the separate syntax is retrieven as
				output, the llll will be always properly shaped, according to the musical hierarchy, without any shortcut.

				Extras.
				The extras in separate syntax.
				Extras are defined in the separate syntax via lllls sent through the Extras inlet, in the form
				<b>[<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>] [<m>extra_name</m> <m>GLOBAL_CONTENT</m>]...</b>
				where each sublist is thus composed by a name (a symbol identifying the extra, one of the following: "graphics", "breakpoints", "slots")
				and a global content, which is just an llll structured exactly according to the object's hierarchy.
				This llll is no different than any other separate parameter llll (say: Cents), only instead of having a single element (number)
				for each note, an llll is given, specifying the content of the extra associated to each note
				(a level of parentheses is needed for each note). If this latter level is dropped, and the information concerns a rest, the extra is assigned to the
				rest, if applicable (e.g. slots).
				For instance, the pitch breakpoints specification for a given note may have the form
				<b>[[0. 0. 0.] [0.5 500 0.5] [1. 0. 0.]]</b>, whereas a complete list of extras to be introduced in the Extras inlet may have the form
				<b>(breakpoints (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.)) (( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1)
				(1. 0. 0.)))) (((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 500 0.5) (1. 0. 0.))) ((( 0. 0. 0. ) (0.5 -200 0.1) (1. 0. 0.))))) (slots ( (((3 10 20 30) (4 0.4))
				((3 10 20 30) (4 0.1))) (())) ())</b>. Notes, chords or voices which don't need a given extras are allowed to be represented as input by
				an empty <b>[]</b> llll. <br />
				The content of each extra is exactly the same as the gathered syntax of such extra, provided that the starting symbol is dropped.
				For instance, instead of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>, one should just have <b>[6200 -1/2]</b> as graphic content for a given note, and so on.
				The syntax for the gathered syntax of all extras is provided below. Remember to drop the extra router symbol to obtain the content
				to be put in the separate syntax llll. <br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>articulation</m> specification informs us about an articulation assigned either to a chord or to a note.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[articulation <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m>]</b>,
				where <m>ARTICULATION_OR_LIST_OF_ARTICULATIONS</m> is a list of symbols idenfitying articulations to be added to the notation item.
				The symbols of the list are allowed to be the following ones: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo" or "trem" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash), "gruppetto" or "grupp". <br />
				The default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do, especially Boulez doesn't have
				a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs. If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.

				Playout.
				Outlet sending information about elements being played, as well as query answers and notifications.
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the playout syntax is used whenever the information about a note or chord is sent through the playout (either at playtime
				or at offline play, or selection dump).
				The playout syntax is a slight variation of the standard chord gathered syntax. Two different cases apply, according to the <m>playmode</m>
				attribute value. If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Chordwise, the information about each chord is output in the form <br />
				<b>chord <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE1</m> <m>NOTE2</m> <m>NOTE3</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where each <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the gathered syntax of the note (see below).
				If the <m>playmode</m> is set to Notewise, information about each note is output as if the note were the only note in the chord, i.e. in the form <br />
				<b>note <m>voice_number</m> <m>MIDI_channel</m> [<m>onset</m> <m>NOTE</m> <m>chord_flag</m>] </b> <br />
				where <b><m>NOTE</m></b> is the note gathered syntax.
				The <m>MIDI_channels</m> is the one associated with the voice to which the note or chord belongs. The <m>onset</m> is in milliseconds,
				The <m>chord_flag</m> is a bitfield summing values of 1 (if chord is locked), 2 (if chord is muted), 4 (if chord is solo). <br />
				The playout syntax also concerns markers: they are output in the form: <b>marker <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> <m>onset_ms</m> <m>role</m> <m>optional:content</m></b>
				where the <m>NAME_OR_NAMES</m> is either a single atom (if the marker has a single name) or a wrapped plain llll containing the names, and the <m>optional:content</m>
				is only output if the marker role requires it.
				<br /> <br />
				In <o>bach.roll</o>, one can assign a role for each marker, so that they can represent elements such as
				time signatures, tempi, barline, measure divisions. Time signature markers and tempi markers
				also require a "content", i.e. an llll specifying the time signature or the tempo.
				When adding a marker via the <m>addmarker</m> message, the role can be specified as third parameter,
				and the content as fourth parameter. Alternatively, roles and content can be set via the marker inspector.
				Roles can be: <br />
				<m>Time Signature</m>: set by the symbol "timesig", it represents a time signature, and expects the time signature llll as content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo timesig [4 4]</b>.<br />
				<m>Tempo</m>: set by the symbol "tempo", it represents a time signature, and expects the tempo llll as content (tempo figure and tempo
				value). For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo tempo [1/8 50]</b>, meaning
				that the tempo is 1/8 = 50.<br />
				<m>Measure Barlines</m>: set by the symbol "barline", it represents a barline, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo barline</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Division</m>: set by the symbol "division", it represents a measure division, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo division</b>. <br />
				<m>Measure Subdivision</m>: set by the symbol "subdivision", it represents a measure subdivision, and expects no content.
				For instance, a message to add such a marker could be <b>addmarker 0 foo subdivision</b>. <br />
				All these marker can be parsed by bach.quantize in order to automatically retrieve the measureinfo of the
				entire bach.roll.
				<br /> <br />
				For <o>bach.roll</o>, the gathered syntax for any note is, in its simplest form <b>[<m>pitch_cents</m> <m>duration</m> <m>velocity</m> <m>note_flag</m>]</b>
				where <m>pitch_cents</m> is the pitch of the note in MIDI cents, the <m>duration</m> is measured in milliseconds, the <m>velocity</m>
				is a value from 1 to 127 corresponding to the note dynamic, and
				the <m>note_flag</m> is an optional bitfield summing values of 1 (if note is locked), 2 (if note is muted), 4 (if note is solo). <br />
				In its most general form, each note can have different specifications and attributes, defining
				graphics, pitch breakpoints, slots, names.
				Each of these specifications is done in the form <b>[<m>specification_name</m> <m>SPECIFICATION CONTENT</m>]</b>, and must be put after the <m>velocity</m>
				and before the <m>note_flag</m>. The order in which the specifications are listed is, on the other hand, irrelevant. For instance, a note definition might have the form
				<b>[7300. 136. 127 [graphic 7400 -1/2] [slots [1 [0. 0. 0.] [0.294118 81.138889 0.] [0.294118 38.805556 0.] [1. 0. 0.]]] [name pippo] 0 ]</b>
				<br /> <br />
				Instead of MIDIcents (or cents), one can also instert pitches.
				The syntax for the single note must be an unique symbol (no spaces) with:
				<b><m>notename</m>-<m>optional:accidental</m>-<m>octave_number</m></b>.
				Dashes are only set in order to separate parts of the symbol, but must not be included in the symbol. <br /> <br />
				Names are in anglo-saxon syntax ("C", "D", "E"...), and are case insentitive. Middle C is C5.
				They and should be immediately followed by the possible accidentals and the
				octave number, without any space (e.g. <b>D#4</b>). <br />
				Accidentals are: <b>#</b> [sharp], <b>b</b> [flat], <b>x</b> [double sharp], <b>q</b> [quartertone sharp], <b>d</b> (quartertone flat),
				<b>^</b> [eighth-tone sharp], <b>v</b> (eighth-tone flat)
				One can also extend the accidental by setting a rational specification followed by a <b>t</b>. For instance <b>C5+1/16t</b> is
				middle C, 1/16 tone up.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>graphic</m> specification informs about the enharmonicity status of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>graphic</m> <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> <m>displayed_accidental</m>]</b>,
				where <m>displayed_midicents_ignoring_accidental</m> are the cents of the diatonic displayed note (ignoring any accidental that it might have),
				and <m>displayed_accidental</m> is the displayed accidental in rational form (sharp corresponding to 1/2, flat to -1/2, quarterflat to -1/4 and so on).
				For instance, a Db just above the middle C would have a graphic specification of <b>[graphics 6200 -1/2]</b>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>breakpoint</m> specification informs about possible pitch breakpoints that a note duration line has. This is useful to represent glissandi.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[<m>breakpoints</m> <m>BPT1</m> <m>BPT2</m> <m>BPT3</m>...]</b>,
				where each <m>BPT</m> is an llll in the form <b>[<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where
				<m>relative_x_position</m> is a double precision number from 0 to 1 representing the point where the breakpoint is, 0 corresponding to
				the notehead and 1 corresponding to the note tail; <m>delta_midicents</m> is the pitch difference (in midicents) between the breakpoint pitch and the base note pitch;
				<m>slope</m> is a value from -1 to 1 corresponding to the curvature of the segment of duration line preceding the breakpoint (this implies that the slope of the first breakpoint
				is always ignored), as for Max <o>curve</o> object (thus 0 being linear). <br />
				Two breakpoints are always present: the first breakpoint corresponds always to (0 0 0), and can never
				be different than this; the last breakpoint corresponds always to the note tail, and must always be in the form <b>[1 <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>.
				If all breakpoints are trivial (thus if there are just two breakpoints: notehead and tail, and the notetail has <m>delta_midicents</m> = 0), the breakpoint
				specification is never given as output. For instance, a note making a glissando upwards and then downwards of 200cents, linear while ascending and exponential in the descent,
				will have the breakpoint specification of the form <b>[breakpoints [0 0 0] [0.5 200 0] [1 0 0.5]]</b>. <br />
				If the <m>breakpointshavevelocity</m> attribute is set to 1, pitch breakpoints also have velocities, thus the complete <m>BPT</m> specification is in the form
				(<m>relative_x_position</m> <m>delta_midicents</m> <m>slope</m> <m>velocity</m>),
				where <m>velocity</m> is a number from 1 to 127 corresponding to the pitch breakpoint dynamic. If different breapoints have different dynamics, the behavior of
				the velocity between them is considered to be interpolatory, for instance by abstractions like <o>bach.dl2line</o> or <o>bach.dl2curve</o>.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>slots</m> specification informs about the content of each one (or a subset) of the slots of a note.
				It is given by an llll in the form <b>[slots <m>SLOT1</m> <m>SLOT2</m>...]</b>,
				where each one of the <m>SLOT</m> is an llll containing the information about one slot, in the form
				<b>[<m>slot_number</m> <m>SLOT_CONTENT</m>]</b>. <br />
				The slot content syntax depends on the slot type. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>function</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first two elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>int</m> or <m>float</m> the content must be in the simplest form: <b><m>number</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>intlist</m> or <m>floatlist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>number1</m> <m>number2</m>...</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>text</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>text_as_an_unique_symbol</m></b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>llll</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_LLLL</m></b>, equivalent to <b>[<m>LLLL</m>]</b>.  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filelist</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>filepath1</m> <m>filepath2</m> <m>filepath3</m>... <m>active_file_index</m></b>,
				where <m>active_file_index</m> is the index of the file which will appear as clicked (active). <br />
				- For slot of type <m>spat</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>SPATPOINT1</m> <m>SPATPOINT2</m> <m>SPATPOINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>SPATPOINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>t</m> <m>radius</m> <m>angle</m> <m>interpolation_type</m>]</b>,
				where the first element is the time position (by default, if the domain is temporal, this is between 0 and 1), then comes the radius
				(distance of the sound from the listener) and the angle which the sound makes with respect to a reference vertical direction.
				Last parameter is an interpolation type, which is 0 (default) for circular spatialization and 1 for linear spatialization. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>color</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>red</m> <m>green</m> <m>blue</m> <m>alpha</m></b>, where
				the parameters are the components of the RGBA color representation (from 0. to 1.).  <br />
				- For slot of type <m>3dfunction</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>POINT1</m> <m>POINT2</m> <m>POINT3</m>...</b> where each
				<m>POINT</m> is in turn in the form <b>[<m>x</m> <m>y</m> <m>z</m> <m>slope</m>]</b>, where the first three elements are the coordinates of the point, and the last one is
				a slope parameter, from -1 to 1, corresponding to the curvature of the segment preceding the point. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>filter</m>, when you need to input content you can use the syntax:
				<b><m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m></b>, where <m>filtertype</m> is one of the following symbols:
				<m>lowpass</m>, <m>highpass</m>, <m>bandpass</m>, <m>bandstop</m>, <m>peaknotch</m>, <m>lowshelf</m>, <m>highshelf</m>, <m>allpass</m>.
				You can equivalently use for input the syntax
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m></b>, where the parameters are the coefficients of a biquad filter, as for <o>biquad~</o>.
				Finally, when data is output, the syntax is always a combination of the two:
				<b><m>a0</m> <m>a0</m> <m>a2</m> <m>b1</m> <m>b2</m> [<m>filtertype</m> <m>cutoff_frequency_Hz</m> <m>gain_dB</m> <m>Q_or_slope</m>]</b>. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>dynfilter</m> the content must be in the form: <b>[<m>t1</m> <m>FILTER1</m>] [<m>t2</m> <m>FILTER2</m>] [<m>t3</m> <m>FILTER3</m>]...</b>, where
				each <m>FILTER</m> is in the form defined for slot of type <m>filter</m>, just above. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>articulations</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>art1</m> <m>art2</m>...</b>, i.e. a sequence of
				articulations introduced as symbols.
				The list of the are standard available articulations as symbols is: "staccato" or "stacc", "staccatissimo" or "staccmo",
				"fermata" or "ferm", "portato" or "por", "accent" or "acc", "accentstaccato" or "accstacc", "accentportato" or "accport",
				"portatostaccato" or "portstacc", "martellato" or "mart", "martellatostaccato" or "martstacc", "lefthandpizzicato" or "lhpiz",
				"trill" or "tr", "gruppetto" or "grupp", "upmordent" or "umord", "downmordent" or "dmord", "doublemordent" or "mmord",
				"upbowing" or "ubow", "downbowing" or "dbow", "tremolo3" or "trem3" (for the tremolo with three slashes), "tremolo2" or "trem2"
				(for the tremolo with two slashes), "tremolo1" or "trem1" (for the tremolo with a single slash).
				Notice that the default bach font has all the articulations glyphs; however, not all the other supported fonts do,
				in particular Boulez doesn't have a certain number of the previous articulations among its glyphs.
				If you don't see an articulation as you wish
				(e.g. tremoli with Boulez), it might be because the font doesn't have the proper character, so try to use another font.
				Articulation symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>notehead</m> the content must a single notehead symbol.
				The list of the standard available noteheads as symbols is: "default", "doublewhole", "whole", "white", "black", "diamond", "cross", "plus",
				"none", "accent", "blacksquare", "whitesquare", "square" "blacktriangle", "whitetriangle", "triangle", "blackrhombus", "whiterhombus", "rhombus".
				In <o>bach.score</o>, the "square", "triangle" and "rhombus" notehead are black or white depending on the note duration; in <o>bach.roll</o> only
				the black flavour is used.
				As for articulations, not all fonts support all symbols.
				Notehead symbols can also be retrieved by hovering on the corresponding element in the slot window. <br />
				- For slot of type <m>togglematrix</m>, <m>intmatrix</m> or <m>floatmatrix</m> the content must be in the form: <b><m>WRAPPED_MATRIX_AS_LLLL</m></b>,
				equivalent to <b>[<m>ROW1</m> <m>ROW2</m>...]</b>, where each row is a wrapped llll.
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.
				<br /> <br />
				The <m>name</m> specification informs us about a possible name (or possibles names) of a notation item.
				It is simply given by an llll in the form <b>[name <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m>]</b>,
				where <m>NAME_OR_LLLL_OF_NAMES</m> is either a single of symbols or integer, or an llll corresponding to the name(s) of the notation item.
				For instance, an item named as "john george" will correspond to the llll <b>[name john george]</b>.
				An item named "(high 1) (low 2)" will correspond to the llll <b>[name [high 1] [low 2]]</b>.
				If an element has no names, the <m>name</m> specification is never given as output.
