				<o>bach.combinevoices</o> expects a list of bach.roll's or bach.score's gathered-syntax
				dump, each wrapped in a level of parenthesis (for instance, by using <o>bach.join</o> with <m>inwrap</m> 1).
				Once it receives such list, it combines all the voices of the received objects into a new bach.roll
				or bach.score, listing all the voices one by one, in the intput order. <br />
				If you don't want all the voices of some bach.roll or bach.score to be considered,
				you can use the <m>subroll</m> or <m>subscore</m> messages instead of the simple <m>dump</m>.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the <t> specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		Markers and all flags (such as solo/mute flags) are all preserved and combined.
		Users can choose which incoming bach.roll or bach.score will be considered for the slotinfo
		and commands information. <br /> <br />
		The slotinfo is the information about the types, ranges and many further characteristics of each one of the slots.
		For bach.roll and bach.score, it is a global information: changing the slotinfo for a given slot will
		affect such slot for all the notes inside the notation object. See the <m>llll</m> method to know more about its syntax.
		Commands are a mechanism to output selected content with given labels.
		You can define up to 5 user commands which will send user-defined messages upon a note or chord evaluation.
		The idea is that you can map each command to a hotkey: if one triggers the hot key (when something is selected),
		this will cause the output of the notes/chord content from the playouts, exactly as if such notes/chords were played.
		The only difference with the simple play situation, is that the router of those messages is not the "note" or "chord" symbol,
		but rather the custom symbol defined at the command declaration. This allows you to properly detect and route the message.
