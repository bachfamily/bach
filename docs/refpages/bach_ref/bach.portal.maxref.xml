				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format, e

	<!--DISCUSSION-->
	<discussion>
		As usual, the formats of the output lllls are controlled by the <m>out</m> attribute.
		In <o>bach.portal</o>, though, the latter can have an additional value, <m>p</m>,
		which allows controlling the output format for subpatchers and abstractions.
		If <o>bach.portal</o>'s <m>out</m> attribute is set to <m>p</m>,
		its outlets are not immediately initialized as soon as the patch is loaded.
		For this reason, a message coming from a <o>loadbang</o> or <o>loadmess</o> object might get lost, or be output in the wrong format.
		When <o>bach.portal</o> is ready, it outputs a <m>bang</m> from its rightmost outlet
		which can be used to trigger any message to output automatically when the patch is loaded.
		<o>bach.portal</o> has a communication mechanism with <o>bach.args</o>,
		ensuring that for each subpatcher <o>bach.portal</o> is ready when <o>bach.args</o> outputs its arguments.
		In this way, it is safe for the arguments of the patch to trigger messages to the outside of the patch itself.
