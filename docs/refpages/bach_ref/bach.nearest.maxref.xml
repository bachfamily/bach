		Snap numbers to nearest elements of an llll
	</digest>

	<description>
		Snaps each number of an incoming llll to the
		nearest number of a given reference plain llll. The snapped elements
		are output, as well as their distances to the original
		elements and the indices of the chosen elements in the reference llll.

				Function depends on inlet
			</digest>
			<description>
				An llll in the first inlet will be considered as the llll whose elements
				have to be snapped to the reference llll. Elements are snapped, and the list of
				the nearest elements (shaped as the original) is output from the first outlet.
				Before that, the list of distances of snapped elements with the original ones is output
				from the third outlet, and the llll containing for each element the index of its nearest
				element in the reference llll is output from the second outlet.
				All lllls have the same structure as the original llll. <br />
				An llll in the second inlet is considered to be the reference plain llll ("grid")
				to which elements should be snapped.

				Outlet Types

			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
