				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
				In this case, the answer is expected to be a modification of the elements which had been sent out:

				such modification will be accounted for by the algorithm. <br />
				The lambda inlet also accepts the result in llll form, so you can sometimes avoid the explicit @out t. <br />

				A lambda outlet is an outlet outputting an element on which some test or modification must be performed.
				The result of the test or modification is then expected in a lambda inlet. <br />
				In this case, the elements output from the lambda outlet may be customly modified, so that such modification will be taken into

				An <m>llll</m> in the left inlet is considered the llll to be organised.
				Elements are output one by one from the right outlet, so that the user can retrieve their
				corresponding keys. Once the keys are re-injected, all the incoming llll is classified
				by keys. The output llll has the form <b>(<m>key1</m> <m>ELEM11</m> <m>ELEM12</m>...)
				(<m>key2</m> <m>ELEM21</m> <m>ELEM22</m>...)</b>, where all the <m>ELEM</m>s are the original
				elements of the list having the corresponding keys. Of course, each element shows up
				in the final list as many times as the number of its keys. <br />
				An llll in the second inlet is considered to be the "answer" of the lambda loop.

				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />

				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message. To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format, e
