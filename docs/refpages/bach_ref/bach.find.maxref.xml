				A lambda inlet is an inlet receiving the answer from a test or modification performed on elements sent out the lambda outlets. <br />
				In this case, the answer is in a 0/1 form: if the element output from the lambda outlet is a match
				(according to your custom matching function, defined in the lambda loop),

				The lambda inlet also accepts the 0/1 result in a native llll form, so you can sometimes avoid the explicit @out t. <br />
				It is important to know that the evaluation chain inside the lambda loop must be direct: you can't use objects such as <o>delay</o>,
				<o>pipe</o>, <o>defer</o>; nor store the value anywhere waiting for some other event to trigger it. Also see #lambda in the bach Help Center.

				Lambda inlet
			</digest>
			<description>
				The criterium by which a given element or sequence of elements is considered a match
				can be customized through an optional lambda loop.
				If the lambda loop is present, the <m>op</m> attribute and the llll received in the second inlet are ignored,
				and elements or sequences of elements (see the <m>size</m> attribute for more details) are output from the lambda outlet.
				The lambda loop should return 1 to the third inlet if the element or sequence is a match, 0 if it is not.

			<description>
				In first inlet: llll to search.
				The matching parts of the llll (single elements or sequences of elements according to the search criteria)
				will be output as sublists of the first outlet llll;
				their addresses will be output as sublists of the second outlet llll. <br />
				An address is an llll providing a unique representation of the position of an element in another llll.
				It is a concept shared by many bach object.
				The address of each element of an llll's root level is simply its position counting from 1.
				The address of an element in a sublist is a list composed by the position of the element in the sublist,
				preceded by the position of the sublist in the parent llll,
				and so on up to the root level, as a sort of "path" to the element.<br />
				For instance, given the llll <b>a b c (d e (f g) h i) j k</b> the position of <b>c</b> is <b>3</b>;
				the position of <b>(d e (f g) h i)</b> is <b>4</b>;
				the position if <b>e</b> is <b>4 2</b> since to reach it it takes to go to the 4th element of the root level, which is a sublist,
				and to the 2nd element of that sublist.
				By reading the address from right to left, it can be seen that this is equivalent to saying
				that the pointed element is the 2nd of the 4th.
				Likewise, in the above llll <b>f</b> has the address <b>4 3 1</b> since it is the 1st of the 3rd of the 4th.<br />
				In second inlet: element or sequence of elements to search for.
				If a lambda loop is not present, the search is performed
				by comparing chunks of the llll in the first inlet to the llll in the second inlet,
				the size of the chunks being the same as the size of the second inlet llll.
				If a lambda loop is present the llll received in the second inlet is ignored,
				the chunks (whose size is determined by the <m>size</m> attribute) are output from the lambda outlet
				and a comparison result is expected in the lambda inlet.
				In third inlet: converted to int.

			<description>
				When set to 1 (default) and a lambda loop is not present,
				sequences whose overall depth is greater than the depth of the comparison llll are not considered matches.
				This means that, for example, if the <b>1 (2 (3))</b> llll is searched for <b>2</b> with the <m>!=</m> operator
				(that is, items different from <b>2</b> are looked for), the found matches will be <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>.
				If <m>depthpolicy</m> was set to 0, the <b>(2 (3))</b> sublist (whose depth is 3) would be compared with <b>2</b> (whose depth is 1),
				found to be different and subsequently considered a match.
				Moreover, with the <m>recursive</m> attribute set to 0, the <b>(2 (3))</b> sublist would not be entered and <b>3</b> would not be found.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the <t> specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
