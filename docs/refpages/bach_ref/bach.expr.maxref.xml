			<digest>
				Expression to evaluate
			</digest>
			<description>
				The expression can contain variables, in the form <m>$in</m>, <m>$rn</m>, <m>$fn</m>, <m>$xn</m>, where <m>n</m> stands for an inlet number.
				<m>$in</m> will refer to an integer value extracted from the llll received in the n-th inlet;
				likewise, <m>$rn</m> will refer to a rational or integer value and <m>$fn</m> to a floating-point value.
				<m>$xn</m> will refer to an untyped value, meaning that the type of the value extracted from the llll will be taken as-is, including symbols (see the description of the <m>llll</m> method).
				Unless specific needs, <m>$xn</m> should be considered the preferred way to express variables.
				For a complete list of the mathematical operators and functions supported by <o>bach.expr</o>, please refer to the help file.

	<!--MESSAGES-->
	<methodlist>
		<method name="bang">
			<arglist />
			<digest>
				Perform the last operation

				Return the result of the evaluation of the most recently received lllls and expression.

		</method>
		<method name="expr">
			<arglist />
			<digest>
				Expression to evaluate
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>expr</m> message, followed by a mathematical expression, will set the new expression to be evaluated by <o>bach.expr</o>.
				For more details on the expression syntax, please refer to the <b>arguments</b> section.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="llll">
			<arglist />
			<digest>
				Store values to the expression variables
			</digest>
			<description>
				The lllls are iterated against each other (as in <o>bach.iter</o> with <m>recursionmode 1</m>),
				the values they contain are assigned to the variables according to the inlet each llll is received in and the llll is evaluated.
				In general, lllls should only be composed of numbers and sublists, but comparison operators also work upon symbols.
				An llll received in the leftmost inlet will trigger the evaluation and cause the result to be output.

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the <t> specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.
