				An address is an llll providing a unique representation of the position of an element in another llll.
				It is a concept shared by many bach object.
				The address of each element of an llll's root level is simply its position counting from 1.
				The address of an element in a sublist is a list composed by the position of the element in the sublist,
				preceded by the position of the sublist in the parent llll,
				and so on up to the root level, as a sort of "path" to the element.<br />
				For instance, given the llll <b>a b c (d e (f g) h i) j k</b> the position of <b>c</b> is <b>3</b>;
				the position of <b>(d e (f g) h i)</b> is <b>4</b>;
				the position if <b>e</b> is <b>4 2</b> since to reach it it takes to go to the 4th element of the root level, which is a sublist,
				and to the 2nd element of that sublist.
				By reading the address from right to left, it can be seen that this is equivalent to saying
				that the pointed element is the 2nd of the 4th.
				Likewise, in the above llll <b>f</b> has the address <b>4 3 1</b> since it is the 1st of the 3rd of the 4th.<br />

				Iterate through the llll
			</digest>
			<description>
				All the lllls received in every llll inlet (that is, all except the rightmost one) are iterated in parallel, element by element.
				This means that the first elements of all the lllls are output, then the second elements, and so on, from their respective dedicate outlets.
				Along with each element, its address is output.
				An address is an llll providing a unique representation of the position of an element in another llll.
				It is a concept shared by many bach object.
				The address of each element of an llll's root level is simply its position counting from 1.
				The address of an element in a sublist is a list composed by the position of the element in the sublist,
				preceded by the position of the sublist in the parent llll,
				and so on up to the root level, as a sort of "path" to the element.<br />
				For instance, given the llll <b>a b c (d e (f g) h i) j k</b> the position of <b>c</b> is <b>3</b>;
				the position of <b>(d e (f g) h i)</b> is <b>4</b>;
				the position if <b>e</b> is <b>4 2</b> since to reach it it takes to go to the 4th element of the root level, which is a sublist,
				and to the 2nd element of that sublist.
				By reading the address from right to left, it can be seen that this is equivalent to saying
				that the pointed element is the 2nd of the 4th.
				Likewise, in the above llll <b>f</b> has the address <b>4 3 1</b> since it is the 1st of the 3rd of the 4th.<br />
				Whenever a sublist is met, three scenarios are possible: <br/>
				In the standard case, a positive integer is output from the rightmost inlet (according to the number of consecutive open parentheses),
				then the sublist is entered and iterated through. <br/>
				If the maximum depth has been reached (see the description of the <m>maxdeph</m> attribute),
				then the sublist is treated as a "normal" element, that is it is output as a whole from the corresponding outlet and not entered.<br/>
				If the <m>lambda</m> attribute is set to 1, a proposal is output from the rightmost outlet.
				A proposal is an llll composed as follows: <br/>
				<m>lambda ( &lt;element 1&gt; ( &lt;address 1 ) &gt; ) ( &lt;element 2&gt; ( &lt;address 2 ) &gt; ) ...</m><br/>
				where at least one element is a sublist. When this happens, a 0 or 1 return value is expected in the rightmost inlet.
				If the return value is 1, the behavior falls back to the standard case.
				If the return value is 0, the sublist is treated as a "normal" element and not entered.
				It must be remarked that the first proposal output in lambda mode, at the very beginning of the iteration process,
				is composed by all the whole input lllls, each associated to an empty address.
				If a return value of 1 is not subsequently received, no actual iteration takes place. <br/>
				Whenever a sublist that was entered ends,
				a negative integer is output from the rightmost inlet (according to the number of consecutive closed parentheses),
				after which the iteration of the parent llll is resumed where it was left when the sublist was entered.
				If the input lllls don't have all the same structure,
				the details of <o>bach.iter</o>'s behavior are defined by the <m>iterationmode</m>, <m>scalarmode</m> and <m>recursionmode</m> attributes.

				<m>maxdepth</m> sets the maximum depth level at which the iteration must be performed.

				This can be useful in special situations where a series of iterations are triggered at different maximum depths,

				Defaults to -1, i.e. there is no limitation (stop at the innermost level).

				Outlet Types
			</digest>
			<description>
				The <m>out</m> attribute is a sequence of characters identifying the outlet types (one character for each llll outlet). Characters can be one of the following: <br />
				<m>n</m> (default): 'native' output: faster and more precise between bach objects, but unreadable by standard Max objects (an "bach.llll" message appears instead). <br />
				<m>t</m>: 'text' output: slower and limited in size, but readable by standard Max objects. A plain llll in text format is a generic Max message.
				To keep the representation invertible (i.e., to allow a bach object receiving a text-format llll to interpret it exactly as if it was native format,
				except for the size limitation), some specific kinds of symbols are preceded by a backtick: namely, symbols containing parens, or containing textual
				representations of numbers or pitches, or beginning with a backtick, plus the symbols "null" and "nil" (distinct from the reserved words
				"null" and "nil" representing the empty list and the empty sublist) are preceded by a backtick. Moreover, the symbols "int", "float" or "list"
				are preceded by a backtick only if they are the first element of an llll, to distinguish them from the corresponding reserved messages of Max. <br />
				<m>m</m>: 'max' output: mostly equivalent to the "t" specifier, but no symbol is backticket except "int", "float" and "list" at the beginning of an llll.
				It is important to notice that, differently from text-format lllls proper, Max-format lllls might not be invertible even if they do not reach the size
				limit for Max message. This means that a bach object receiving a Max-format llll output from another bach object might interpret it differently
				from the original, or in some cases might even reject it. <br />
				<m>x</m>: disabled output (nothing is output) <br />
				<m>p</m>: 'portal' output: only used by bach.portal to intercept the @out attribute specified while creating the abstraction (see bach.portal). <br />
				The native output is recommended, unless communication with standard Max messages is needed.
				Disabling unused outputs can be useful if extreme optimization of the patch is needed.

			<description>
				A spike in an llll is a sequence of parentheses at least two of which are opposite:
				for instance, <b>()</b> or <b>((()</b> or <b>))()(</b>.
				The <m>spikemode</m> attribute controls <o>bach.iter</o>'s behavior when a spike is met.
				When set to 0 (the default), a distinct integer for each sequence of same-direction parentheses
				is output from the rightmost outlet:
				for instance, <b>()</b> will cause the sequence <m>1</m>, <m>-1</m> to be output;
				<b>((()</b> will cause <m>3</m>, <m>-1</m> to be output;
				<b>))()(</b> will cause <m>-2</m>, <m>1</m>, <m>-1</m>, <m>1</m> to be output.
				This setting is most useful in conjunction with <o>bach.collect</o>. <br />
				When the <m>spikemode</m> attribute is set to 1, a single integer is output from the rightmost outlet for the whole spike.
				The integer represents the depth difference between the last element before the spike and the first element after it.
				The integers output for the previous examples would then be 0, 2, -1. <br />
				When the <m>spikemode</m> attribute is set to 2, the values that are output are the same as for <m>spikemode 0</m>.
				In addition, after each value a set of <b>null</b> addresses and data is output from the llll outlets.
