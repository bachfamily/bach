			<description>
				The object outputs the rank of the incoming matrix. <br />
				In the bach environment, a matrix is just a llll having depth two, whose first-level sublllls are the rows of the matrix.
				For instance the matrix <b>[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1]</b> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix. A "good" matrix is supposed to be well formed,
				i.e. all its rows must have the same length. A matrix is square if the length of the rows (which is the number of columns) is the same
				as the number of rows.

	<discussion>
		The determinant of the matrix is computed by Gaussian elimination and then
		by counting the number of pivots. By convention the rank of <b>null</b> is -1 and
		the rank of <b>[]</b> is 0. <br /> <br />
