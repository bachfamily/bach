===================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================================================

Intel-based Mac or Windows computer running Max 7.3.5 or higher (except for version 8.0.5 on Windows)


===================================================
HOW TO INSTALL
===================================================

You should install bach directly from the Max Package Manager.


Alternatively, you can copy the "bach" folder inside the "packages" folder in your Max folder. The Max packages folder is under "Documents/Max 7" (for Max 7) or "Documents/Max 8" (for Max 8).

If you installed bach "by hand" on a Mac, chances are that you'll have to remove the quarantine manually as well. 
The simplest way to do it is by going in the terminal and typing

xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Packages/bach/*

or substitute the folder where the package is in, if it's a different one. 


You can also build bach from its source code. For more information about this, see below.


===================================================
HOW TO UNINSTALL
===================================================

Uninstall from Max Package Manager, or delete the "bach" folder from the "packages" folder.


===================================================
HOW TO SUPPORT BACH
===================================================

You can support the bach project on Patreon, at the page https://www.patreon.com/bachproject

Developing and maintaining the bach project is a huge work, which has been taking significant effort and a good chunk of our time since 2010. Most of the work is on the core system (bach), which is freelance project with no institutional support: we rely on Patreon to try to make it sustainable for us.

If you think that bach is not worth your money, or if you canâ€™t afford to pay anything, that's absolutely ok and you then should not contribute. However, if you think that bach is useful and if you can afford to pay us as little as a cup of coffee per month, then you might want to contribute, because this will help keeping bach alive, maintained, and free for everyone.

What do you get for contributing? As we said, contributions are targeted to keeping bach alive, supported and free. The most important thing you get, we hope, is the warm feeling of being part of a family that makes all of this possible!

All Patrons obtain a code to remove the bach splash screen in their patches for the whole solar year (on the other hand, removing the splash screen from standalones is unfortunately more complicated, and might require particular arrangements).

In addition, Patrons get several benefits: from early access to prereleases, all the way up to private Skype/Google Hangouts meeting for the top tier (passing through a set of exclusive video tutorials and the possibility to submit feature requests).


===================================================
WHERE TO START
===================================================

The patch "bach.overview" (located in the "Extras" Max's menu) contains a detailed documentation of all the global system features (which you should read entirely), and links to the help files of all the externals and abstractions. We have tried to keep all this information in a somewhat pedagogical order, and in principle you are encouraged to run through it from beginning to end to get an idea of the tools you are provided with.

The best thing to do to start learning bach is following the tutorials that you find in the "bach.overview". 
You can also access a series of video tutorials from our Patreon page; for some of the videos Patrons have early access (1 year before anyone else), but you can still access all the other ones, as well as the old patrons-only videos when after 1 year from they creation (also see the Patreon section above).

The only prerequisite to bach is a solid (but not necessarily hyper-advanced) knowledge of Max. The documentation will sometimes hint at advanced topics, such as threading, but if you don't feel at ease with them you can simply overlook them.

Of course, experimentation is always the core of understanding. As soon as you get the very first notions, the best you can do is start patching. Just remember that this is a beta release: save your patches and data as often as you can - we can't assure you that Max won't hang or crash as soon as you click that button you just added!


===================================================
BUILDING FROM SOURCE
===================================================

As bach is an open source project as of v0.8.1, it is possible to download its complete source code and build the library from it.
The source code of bach is hosted on Github, at the URL https://github.com/bachfamily/bach
The repository is identical to the bach Max package, except that it does not contain the binaries (which you are supposed to be willing to build if you download it), but it rather contains a "source" folder with all the source code, third-party dependencies included (see below), except the Max SDK. You should install the bach folder downloaded from Github, or clone the repository, directly in your Max packages folder, instead of the bach package from the Package Manager.
Generally speaking, the master branch contains the latest version of bach that has been published in the Package Manager. This is the branch you are recommended to check out.

On a Mac, you need the following tools for building bach:
- Xcode (a relatively new version, but we're not actually sure which is the minimum requirement). You also need to install the command line tools when required; or you can install them later on if you need to, by entering
	xcode-select --install
in the terminal.
- A modified version of the Max SDK version 8.2.0, installed in the Max packages folder. See below for how to install our modified version.
- Flex (version 2.6.0 or higher) and Bison (version 2.3 or higher). You need to install manually Flex and Bison (you can use Homebrew or Macports), as the versions provided with Xcode are not compatible with the grammars included in bach.
The provided makefiles look for the correct versions of Flex and Bison respectively in /opt/homebrew/opt/bison/bin and /opt/homebrew/opt/flex/bin, which is where one version of Homebrew installs them. Macports, as well as other versions of Homebrew, installs them elsewhere. No big deal: just add an alias in the above folders, pointing to the correct location; or fix all the makefiles on your machine. The makefiles are located in each subfolder of bach/source/commons/parsers, and in bach/source/commons/bell/stringparsers. A cleaner way on our end might actually be including a configure script in the distribution, but I'm afraid we have other priorities.

On Windows, you only need Visual Studio 2017 or higher, but there is a manipulation you should perform:
The file bach\source\resources\bach_resources.rc, which contains references to cursors, fonts etc. for the compiler, references them through an absolute path on Andrea's machine. There may be a way to make the path relative, but we couldn't find it. So you should open the file with any text editor and change all the occurrences of C:\\Users\\aa\\blahblah... to C:\\Users\\<<<your home folder name>>>\\blahblah...

THE MODIFIED MAX SDK

The Max 8.2 SDK seems to have some issues of redefined symbols, so currently bach needs to use a slightly modified version of it. If you don't have the Max SDK yet, or you don't mind losing any modifications or additions you did and the externals you built, the easiest is running these command lines from the Max Package folder:

	git clone https://github.com/bachfamily/max-sdk
	cd max-sdk
	git submodule update --init --recursive
	cd source/max-sdk-base
	git checkout bach

If you don't want to lose everything you alredy did in the Max SDK package, then you should retrieve the relevant files from the modified version and substitute the original ones with them. The easiest is to run the above command line from just any other folder (it can as well be your Desktop or Downloads), drag the following files from the newly cloned SDK to your old one and throw away the new one:
	max-sdk/source/max-sdk-base/c74support/c74_max.h
	max-sdk/source/max-sdk-base/c74support/max-includes/common/jpatcher_syms.c
	max-sdk/source/max-sdk-base/c74support/max-includes/ext_obex.h
	max-sdk/source/max-sdk-base/script/max-pretarget.cmake

A FURTHER NOTE ON PARSERS

bach contains a number of Flex / Bison lexers and parsers tackling the llll textual representation, bach.expr expressions and bell programs. The bach repository contains both the Flex / Bison grammar files (.l and .y), with the makefiles invoking Flex and Bison, and the C code files they produce. This is somewhat unorthodox, but necessary because currently Flex and Bison are only invoked when bach is built on a Mac, whereas on Windows the .l, .y and makefiles are ignored, and bach is only built from the C code files. So, if you are a Windows user and you want to modify the grammars, you have to either find a compatible Flex / Bison distribution for Windows, install it and run it on your machine (and, why not, share some information about it with the bach dev community and us), or generate the lexers and parsers on a UNIX machine and transfer them to Windows. If you don't want to fiddle with the grammars instead, you can avoid installing Flex and Bison on a Mac as well, and modify the makefiles or the relevant build targets so as not to invoke them when the project is built (and perhaps adding an exclude file to your local repository, so that these customizations are preserved whenever you pull from the remote).

READY, SET, GO

Once you have installed Xcode or Visual Studio; the bach source and the modified Max SDK; decided what you want to do with the parsers and acted accordingly; if you're on Windows, modified bach_resources,rc: once you've done all this, you can just open Xcode or Visual Studio and build the project or solution respectively. On Xcode you will be asked if you want to autocreate schemes: answer "Yes", and then choose the scheme "bach-everything". On Windows, you might end up with two objects in the "extensions" folder of the package, named respectively bach.mxe64 and bachB.mxe64. This is a mistake on our end, that will prevent bach from working. If this is the case, just erase bachB.mxe64. We shall fix this in a future version.

Good luck!

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===================================================

This project has been partially undertaken during the permanence of the authors at IRCAM, first as students at the Cursus in Composition and Musical Informatics and then as composers in research.

The bell programming language has been conceived and developed by Andrea Agostini within the context of a MRC residency at IRCAM, under the supervision of Jean Louis Giavitto.

We wish to thank Carlos Agon, GÃ©rard Assayag, Arshia Cont, Emmanuel Jourdan, Serge Lemouton, Jean Lochard, Mikhail Malt and all the other people at IRCAM who have supported and encouraged the work, although not an internal IRCAM project. We would like to especially acknowledge the friendship of the late Ã‰ric Daubresse, one of the earliest and most enthousiastic supporters of bach.

We also wish to thank Cycling '74 for their help with allowing bach do the obscure things it does inside Max, in particular Jeremy Bernstein, Joshua Kit Clayton, Emmanuel Jourdan (once again!), Andrew Pask, Gregory Taylor and David Zicarelli.

A special thanks goes to Robert PiÃ©chaud, for giving us a customized, open-source version of his beautiful "November" music font for inclusion in bach.

Finally, we wish to thank all our Patreon supporters, whose generous contribution is a tangible encouragement to carry on our quixotic work.
